To design a website with a header, main content area, and footer, while ensuring it is semantic, responsive, SEO-friendly, accessible, performant, secure, and maintainable, follow these steps:

1. **Structure with Semantic Tags**:
   - Use `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for semantic structure.
   - Place navigation within the header using the `<nav>` tag.

2. **Content Placement**:
   - **Header**: Include the website's logo, navigation menu, and possibly a search bar.
   - **Main Content**: Organize content using semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, or `<div>` as needed. Use responsive grid layouts for different screen sizes.
   - **Footer**: Include contact information, privacy policy, social media links, and copyright info.

3. **CSS Framework Integration**:
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS for utility classes to achieve responsive design. For example, use grid classes for layout adjustments on different screen sizes.

4. **SEO and Accessibility**:
   - Ensure all major content is accessible via semantic HTML tags.
   - Add `alt` attributes to images, use `aria` labels where necessary, and ensure the site is navigable via keyboard and screen readers.
   - Include meta tags like `<meta name="description">` and `<meta name="keywords">` for improved SEO.

5. **Typography and Styling**:
   - Apply imported fonts consistently by setting them in the CSS using `@import` statements or font links.
   - Define global styles in the `style.css` file to ensure consistency across the site.

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use lazy loading for images and implement proper caching strategies.
   - Optimize images and consider using a content delivery network (CDN) for faster load times.

7. **Security Measures**:
   - Follow best practices to prevent SQL injections and XSS attacks, especially if implementing a backend.
   - Regularly update dependencies and use secure coding practices.

8. **Maintainability**:
   - Separate CSS into different files for different sections if needed, but ensure overall organization and readability.
   - Use version control systems like Git for easy management and updates.

By following these guidelines, your website will be well-structured, visually appealing, and functional across all devices, while also being optimized for search engines and user accessibility.
