The code you've provided sets up a basic router using Express.js, a web framework for Node.js. Here's an explanation of each part:

### 1. **Importing Express**  
```javascript
import express from 'express';
```
This line imports the `express` module, allowing you to use its features to build web applications.

### 2. **Creating a Router Instance**  
```javascript
const router = express.Router();
```
This creates an instance of an Express router. Routers in Express are used to define different routes and handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) for specific paths. A router acts like a mini Express application that can be modularized and used in your main application.

### 3. **Defining a Route**  
```javascript
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('THIS WORKS!');
});
```
This defines a **GET route** for the path `/`. When an HTTP GET request is made to this route, the callback function `(req, res)` is invoked. Here, `req` is the request object (containing information about the request), and `res` is the response object (used to send a response back to the client).

In this case, it sends a simple string `"THIS WORKS!"` as a response to the client when the root URL is accessed.

### 4. **Exporting the Router**  
```javascript
export default router;
```
This line exports the `router` instance so it can be used in other parts of your application. Typically, this would be imported into a main Express application to be mounted on a specific path.

### **How to Use This Router in Your Application:**

Assuming this router is defined in a separate file (e.g., `router.js`), you would use it in your main Express app like this:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import router from './router'; // Import the router

const app = express();

// Mount the router on a specific path (e.g., '/api')
app.use('/api', router);

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Here, any request to `/api/` will be handled by the routes defined in `router.js`. For example, a GET request to `/api/` will trigger the response "THIS WORKS!" from your router.

### **Summary**:
- The code defines a basic Express router.
- It handles a GET request to the root path `/` and responds with "THIS WORKS!".
- The router is exported for use in other parts of the application.
- To start the application, you would need to import the router in your main Express app and mount it.
