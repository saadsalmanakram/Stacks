(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

25- What is a design pattern?

Ans- A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in software design.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

26- How many classic design patterns are there?

Ans- There are 23 classic design patterns.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

27- What is the purpose of design patterns?

Ans- Design patterns provide a common language for discussing solutions and enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

28- What is the Observer pattern used for?

Ans- The Observer pattern is used for defining a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

29- What is the Proxy pattern used for?

Ans- The Proxy pattern is used for providing a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

30- How does the Singleton pattern ensure a class has only one instance?

Ans- The Singleton pattern restricts instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

31- What is the Factory Method pattern?

Ans- The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

32- What is the Strategy pattern used for?

Ans- The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing algorithms to vary independently from clients.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

33- What is the Adapter pattern?

Ans- The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by preventing direct references between objects.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

40- What is the Builder pattern used for?

Ans- The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

41- What is the Chain of Responsibility pattern?

Ans- The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows multiple objects to handle a request without the sender needing to know which object will handle it.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

42- What is the State pattern?

Ans- The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if the object changed its class.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

43- What is the Flyweight pattern used for?

Ans- The Flyweight pattern is used for minimizing memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

44- What is the Bridge pattern?

Ans- The Bridge pattern separates abstraction from implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

46- How does the Abstract Factory pattern differ from the Factory Method pattern?

Ans- The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes, whereas the Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating a single object.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

47- What is the purpose of design pattern diagrams?

Ans- Design pattern diagrams illustrate the roles and relationships of pattern elements, aiding in understanding and communication.
