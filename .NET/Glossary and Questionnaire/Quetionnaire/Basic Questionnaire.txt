Ans- OOP allows for modular design and code reuse, making it easier to extend and modify applications.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1120- What is the difference between default and nondefault constructors?

Ans- Default constructors have no parameters and initialize objects with default values, while nondefault constructors accept parameters to initialize objects with specific values.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1121- What does it mean if a class has no public constructors?

Ans- The class is noncreatable from outside its definition, often used for utility or factory classes.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

Ans- Association represents a relationship between two classes where one class uses or interacts with another.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1129- What is aggregation?

Ans- Aggregation is a special form of association where one class contains another class but both can exist independently.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1130- What is composition?

Ans- Composition is a strong form of aggregation where the contained class cannot exist independently of the containing class.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1131- What is dependency in OOP?

Ans- Dependency indicates that one class depends on another, typically through method parameters or return types.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1132- What is the difference between association and dependency?

Ans- Association is a broader relationship between classes, while dependency specifically indicates that one class relies on another to function.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1133- What is operator overloading?

Ans- Operator overloading allows you to redefine the way operators work with class instances.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1134- What must be true for two overloaded operators in C#?

Ans- They must have at least one operand of the type that is overloading the operator.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1135- Can operator overloading change the precedence of operators?

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1138- How are events different from methods?

Ans- Events are used to trigger methods (event handlers) in response to certain actions.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1139- Can events be declared as static?

Ans- Yes, events can be declared as static if they need to be associated with a class rather than an instance.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1140- What is the difference between value types and reference types?

Ans- Value types store data directly, while reference types store a reference to the data.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1141- What is boxing and unboxing in C#?

Ans- Boxing is converting a value type to a reference type, and unboxing is converting it back to a value type.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

Ans- It will result in a SystemOverflowException at runtime.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1146- Why is it important to understand the sequence of constructor calls in class inheritance?

Ans- It helps prevent errors during object instantiation, particularly with incorrect base class initialization.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1147- What is a constructor initializer, and when would you use it?

Ans- A constructor initializer specifies another constructor to be called before the current one; it’s used to centralize and reuse initialization logic.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1148- What happens if you don’t specify a constructor in your C# class?

Ans- The compiler provides a default constructor that calls the base class’s default constructor.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1149- Why might you want to call a non-default base class constructor in a derived class?

Ans- To pass specific parameters to the base class for proper initialization.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1150- Can you pass literal values to a base class constructor from a derived class constructor?

Ans- Yes, you can pass literal values using the base keyword.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

Ans- Errors can lead to incomplete or incorrect object initialization, causing unexpected behavior.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1154- What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy of an object?

Ans- A shallow copy copies the object's members by reference, while a deep copy creates new instances of the referenced objects.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1155- What method is used to perform a shallow copy in .NET?

Ans- The MemberwiseClone() method is used to perform a shallow copy.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1156- Why is shallow copying not ideal in some cases?

Ans- Because reference members in the copied object still refer to the same instances as in the original object, which can lead to unintended side effects.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1157- What is the purpose of the ICloneable interface in .NET?

Ans- The ICloneable interface provides a standard way to implement object cloning, allowing either shallow or deep copying depending on the implementation of the Clone() method.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1158- Why do some recommend avoiding the use of the ICloneable interface?

Ans- The ICloneable interface does not enforce whether the copy should be shallow or deep, leading to ambiguity and potential misuse.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1159- How would you define a non-creatable class in C#?

Ans- By declaring the class as abstract, making it impossible to instantiate directly.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1160- Why are non-creatable (abstract) classes still useful?

Ans- They provide a common base for other classes, allowing shared code and enforcing a consistent interface across derived classes.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1161- What is the default behavior of a constructor and destructor in C#?

Ans- Constructors initialize an object, while destructors are called when an object is destroyed, but custom destructors are rarely needed.

Ans- No, all parts of a partial class must have the same accessibility.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1172- What is the difference between a field and a property in C#?

Ans- A field is a variable directly accessible from the class, while a property controls access to a field through getters and setters.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1173- When would you use the readonly keyword in C#?

Ans- When you want a field to be assigned only during construction and not modified afterward.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1174- How does a const differ from a readonly field?

Ans- const fields are compile-time constants and cannot be changed, while readonly fields can be assigned once at runtime.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1175- What is an expression-bodied member in C#?

Ans- A concise syntax that allows the implementation of a property, method, or indexer with a single expression.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1176- Why are properties preferred for accessing the state of an object?

Ans- Properties shield external code from the implementation details and offer greater control over data access.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1177- What are automatic properties in C#?

Ans- Automatic properties simplify property declaration by allowing the compiler to generate the backing field.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1178- What is the difference between hiding and overriding a method in C#?

Ans- Hiding replaces a base method without polymorphism, while overriding replaces a base method with polymorphism.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1179- How can you access a hidden or overridden base class method in C#?

Ans- Use the base keyword within the derived class.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1180- What is the this keyword used for in C#?

Ans- It refers to the current instance of the class and is used to qualify members or pass the instance to methods.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1181- Can static members use the this keyword?

Ans- No, because static members are not part of an object instance.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

1182- Can you define a private field in an interface?

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1190- Can partial methods have a return type?

Ans- No, partial methods cannot have a return type.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1191- What happens if a partial method is declared but not implemented?

Ans- If a partial method is not implemented, both the method and its calls are removed during compilation.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1192- Why can't partial methods be virtual or abstract?

Ans- Partial methods are designed for optional implementation, so they cannot be virtual or abstract.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1193- What is the visibility scope of a partial method?

Ans- Partial methods are always private.

Ans- It allows for cleaner organization, easier collaboration, and reduces the complexity of large classes.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1197- Can you apply an interface to only one part of a partial class?

Ans- No, applying an interface to one part of a partial class applies it to the entire class.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1198- In the context of partial classes, how does C# handle multiple parts implementing the same method?

Ans- C# will compile an error if multiple parts of a partial class implement the same method with a body.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1199- How do partial methods improve performance when not implemented?

Ans- If a partial method is not implemented, the compiler removes both the method and its calls, avoiding unnecessary overhead.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1200- Why is it important that partial methods cannot have out parameters?

Ans- Because the compiler needs to ensure that no external state is affected if the method is not implemented.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1201- What are collections in C#?

Ans- Collections in C# are classes that store groups of related objects, providing more functionality than arrays like dynamic sizing and sorting.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1214- How do you implement deep cloning for a collection of objects?

Ans- You clone each object in the collection individually using a loop.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1215- What is the purpose of boxing in C#?

Ans- Boxing allows value types to be treated as objects or interface types.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1216- What is unboxing, and how does it differ from boxing?

Ans- Unboxing is the conversion from a reference type back to a value type, requiring explicit casting.


(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1217- Why is deep copying more complicated for collections than individual objects?

Ans- Each object in the collection must be cloned, not just the collection itself.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1218- How does pattern matching enhance the is operator in C#?

Ans- It allows the is operator to perform type checks and extract information from the matched object directly.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1219- What is the result of boxing a value type?

Ans- A new object is created containing a reference to a copy of the value type.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1220- Why does unboxing require explicit casting in C#?

Ans- Because unboxing converts from a reference type back to the original value type, which requires verification.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1221- What’s the key difference between comparing boxed value types and reference types?

Ans- Boxed value types refer to a copy, while reference types point to the original object.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

Ans- Generics improve code flexibility by allowing you to write strongly typed collections and methods without specifying exact types.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1243- What problem do generics solve in collections?

Ans- Generics eliminate the need for casting and type checking in collections, ensuring type safety.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1244- How do generics differ from C++ templates?

Ans- In C#, generics are handled at runtime, while in C++, templates are handled at compile time.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1245- What happens if you access the Value property of a nullable type when it’s null?

Ans- It throws a System.InvalidOperationException.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1246- How do nullable types handle operators like +, -, etc.?

Ans- Operators work as expected, but if one operand is null, the result will be null.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1247- What does the ?? (null coalescing) operator do?

Ans- It returns the first non-null value between two operands.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1248- How does the ?. (null conditional) operator work?

Ans- It returns null if the preceding object is null, preventing exceptions when accessing members of null objects.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1249- What is the difference between covariance and contravariance in C#?

Ans- Covariance allows a method to return more derived types, while contravariance allows a method to accept less derived types.

Ans- It adds the elements of a specified collection to the end of the List<T>.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1267- Can you instantiate a generic class with a type that does not have a default constructor?

Ans- No, because you can't create an instance of the type without a parameterless constructor.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1268- How do you handle a situation where you need a default value for a generic type?

Ans- Use the default keyword, e.g., innerT1Object = default(T1);.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1269- Why might you use the default keyword in a generic class constructor?

Ans- To assign a default value for the generic type T1, which could be null for reference types or a default value for value types.

Ans- Yes, using constraints like where T2 : T1 where T2 must be the same type or inherit from T1.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1275- What is a circular type constraint and why is it not allowed?

Ans- A circular type constraint, such as where T1 : T2 and where T2 : T1, is not allowed because it creates an ambiguous dependency between type parameters.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1276- What happens if you inherit from a generic class with more relaxed constraints than the base class?

Ans- It results in a compilation error because the derived class must meet the constraints set by the base class.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1277- How do you specify type parameters when inheriting from a generic class?

Ans- You must provide all type parameters in the derived class definition, e.g., class Derived : Base<T> { ... }.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1280- What is the purpose of the + operator overload in a generic class?

Ans- It allows you to combine two instances of the class or perform operations that involve instances of the class, e.g., merging two Farm<T> instances.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1281- What is covariance in C#?

Ans- Covariance allows a type to be substituted with a more derived type in generic interfaces or delegates.

(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

1282- Can covariant type parameters be used as method parameters?
