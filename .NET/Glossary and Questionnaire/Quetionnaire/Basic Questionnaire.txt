(-----------------------------------------------------------------------)

191- How can you reprogram the Composite pattern with separate interfaces for components and composites?

Ans- Define IComponent for common operations and IComposite<T> for operations specific to composites, separating the concerns and reducing generic complexity.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

192- What is the primary benefit of the Flyweight pattern?

Ans- The Flyweight pattern reduces memory usage by sharing common intrinsic state among many objects while storing only the unique extrinsic state separately.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

193- In the Photo Group application, what is the role of the intrinsic and extrinsic states?

Ans- The intrinsic state is the thumbnail image (shared), while the extrinsic state is the full-size image (computed on demand) and the group information.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

194- How does the FlyweightFactory manage Flyweight objects?

Ans- The FlyweightFactory uses a dictionary to store and manage unique Flyweight objects, ensuring that only one instance of each unique Flyweight is created.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

195- What is the difference between using structs and classes for Flyweights in the Flyweight pattern?

Ans- Structs are used for Flyweights due to their lightweight nature and value semantics, avoiding the overhead of reference-type classes.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

196- How can you enhance the Flyweight pattern's performance in the context of large numbers of images?

Ans- By using thumbnail images (intrinsic state) to represent large images (extrinsic state), the pattern efficiently manages memory and improves performance for large image sets.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

197- What is the purpose of the Adapter pattern?

Ans- The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface expected by the client.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

200- What role does the ITarget interface play in the Adapter pattern?

Ans- The ITarget interface defines the expected interface that the client works with, which the adapter conforms to.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)


201- What is the difference between a class adapter and an object adapter?

Ans- A class adapter uses inheritance to adapt the interface, while an object adapter uses composition.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

202- In the Adapter pattern, what does the Adapter class do?

Ans- It implements the ITarget interface and translates requests to the Adaptee's interface.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

203- Provide an example of where an Adapter pattern might be used in real life.

Ans- The Accelerate framework on macOS, which adapts old PowerPC code to run on Intel processors.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

213- What is a Two-Way Adapter in design patterns?

Ans- A Two-Way Adapter allows objects to interact with systems or components that have incompatible interfaces by adapting methods and properties between them.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

214- Why is a Two-Way Adapter necessary in C#?

Ans- It's needed because C# does not support multiple inheritance, so a Two-Way Adapter can combine the functionalities of two different interfaces or classes, adapting their methods for mutual compatibility.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

215- How does a Two-Way Adapter differ from a regular Adapter?

Ans- A Two-Way Adapter can act as both an adapter and an adaptee, meaning it can handle method calls from both sides of the adaptation, unlike a regular Adapter which handles calls only from one side.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

216- Can you provide an example scenario where a Two-Way Adapter is useful?

Ans- An example is running Windows on a Mac with an Intel processor, where the Two-Way Adapter allows Windows (SSE instructions) and Mac OS X (AltiVec instructions) to operate effectively with the Intel processor.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

217- What are the main components of a Two-Way Adapter?

Ans- The main components are the ITarget interface, the IAdaptee interface, and the Adapter class that implements both interfaces and adapts the methods between them.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

218- What limitations are there with the Two-Way Adapter pattern?

Ans- Limitations include potential complexity in managing multiple interfaces and ensuring the adapter properly translates between all involved systems without creating a tangled design.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

219- How does a Two-Way Adapter handle properties and methods differently compared to a regular Adapter?

Ans- A Two-Way Adapter must handle both properties and methods from multiple interfaces, ensuring proper adaptation in both directions, while a regular Adapter typically manages only one direction of adaptation.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

220- What is the role of delegates in the context of pluggable adapters?

Ans- Delegates in pluggable adapters allow dynamic method assignment and invocation, enabling flexible adaptation of different methods and interfaces at runtime.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

225- How does the Façade Pattern differ from the Adapter Pattern?

Ans- The Façade Pattern provides a new high-level interface to a subsystem, while the Adapter Pattern converts an existing interface to a different one.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)

Ans- An opaque Façade hides all subsystem details, only exposing high-level operations to the client.

(------------------------------------------------------------------------)
