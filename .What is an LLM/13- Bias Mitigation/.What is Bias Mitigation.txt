Bias mitigation in the context of language models refers to the techniques and strategies employed to identify, reduce, or eliminate biases in these models. Biases in language models can manifest in various forms, such as gender bias, racial bias, or cultural bias, and can influence the model's outputs and decisions in unintended and potentially harmful ways.
