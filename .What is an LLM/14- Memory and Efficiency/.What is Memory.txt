Memory in language models refers to the capacity of the model to store and utilize information during its operation. This includes both the modelâ€™s ability to retain information about previous context within a single session (short-term memory) and its ability to learn and store information over multiple training sessions (long-term memory).

Types:

 - Short-Term Memory: This involves maintaining context within a single sequence or conversation. For example, a model needs to remember the context of a conversation to generate coherent responses.

 - Long-Term Memory: This involves storing knowledge learned during training that can be applied across different tasks and queries. For instance, a model trained on diverse data should have long-term memory of facts, language structures, and patterns.
