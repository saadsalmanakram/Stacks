Training data refers to the corpus of text used to teach the model to understand and generate human-like text. This data consists of a wide variety of text sources, such as books, articles, websites, and other written materials. The goal is to expose the model to diverse language patterns, vocabulary, and contexts so it can learn to make predictions about text, such as generating coherent sentences, answering questions, or completing text prompts.
