# Understanding Language Model Architectures

## üìå Overview
Welcome to **Understanding Language Model Architectures**, a repository dedicated to exploring and teaching various architectures used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repository covers traditional and modern deep learning approaches, including:

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)**
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)**
- **Transformer Models**
- **Autoregressive Models (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA)**
- **Autoencoding Models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA)**
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models (T5, BART, mT5)**
- **Hybrid Architectures (Encoder-Decoder, Attention Mechanisms)**

This repository is intended for researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts who want to gain a deep understanding of how different language model architectures work.
