With this statement we can control how many different sequences are generated 

for example, we can limit to generating to 2 sequences

python code:

'''

from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="distilgpt2")
generator(
    "In this course, we will teach you how to",
    max_length=30,
    num_return_sequences=2,
)
