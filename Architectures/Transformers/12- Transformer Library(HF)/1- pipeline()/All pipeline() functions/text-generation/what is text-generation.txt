The text-generation function takes a prompt and automatically continues it by generating the remaining text, like a predictive text feature on a phone.


Python Code:

'''

from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation")
generator("In this course, we will teach you how to")

'''

output:

'''

[{'generated_text': 'In this course, we will teach you how to understand and use '
                    'data flow and data interchange when handling user data. We '
                    'will be working with one or more of the most commonly used '
                    'data flows â€” data flows of various types, as seen by the '
                    'HTTP'}]
