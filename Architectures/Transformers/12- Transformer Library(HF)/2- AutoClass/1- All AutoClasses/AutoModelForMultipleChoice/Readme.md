### `AutoModelForMultipleChoice` 

- **Purpose**:  
  This is a generic model class from the Hugging Face `transformers` library that is used for creating models with a multiple choice head. It can instantiate any model class (such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, etc.) with a multiple choice head based on a provided configuration.
  
- **Instantiation**:  
  This class cannot be instantiated directly using the `__init__()` method. Instead, it is instantiated by using the `from_pretrained()` or `from_config()` class methods. 
  If you try to instantiate it directly, it will raise an error.

### `from_config` Method

- **Purpose**:  
  The `from_config` method instantiates a model from a given configuration. The model type (e.g., BERT, ALBERT) is determined based on the configuration class provided. It does not load any weights, only the model's architecture.

- **Parameters**:
  - **config** (`PretrainedConfig`): This parameter is used to determine which model class to instantiate. The configuration class identifies which model architecture (like `BertConfig`, `AlbertConfig`, etc.) is used for instantiation.
  
  - The configuration class can represent:
    - `AlbertConfig` → `AlbertForMultipleChoice` (ALBERT)
    - `BertConfig` → `BertForMultipleChoice` (BERT)
    - `DistilBertConfig` → `DistilBertForMultipleChoice` (DistilBERT)
    - And many others (e.g., `RobertaConfig` → `RobertaForMultipleChoice`).

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForMultipleChoice
  
  # Download configuration from huggingface.co and cache.
  config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')
  
  # Instantiate model using the configuration.
  model = AutoModelForMultipleChoice.from_config(config)
  ```

  **Note**:  
  When using `from_config()`, the model’s weights are not loaded. It only affects the configuration. To load weights, you must use `from_pretrained()`.

### `from_pretrained` Method

- **Purpose**:  
  The `from_pretrained()` method is used to instantiate a model with weights loaded from a pre-trained model stored on Hugging Face's model hub or from a local directory. The class and model are selected based on the `pretrained_model_name_or_path` provided, or by inspecting the configuration (if provided).

- **Parameters**:
  - **pretrained_model_name_or_path** (`str` or `os.PathLike`): This is the identifier of a pretrained model from the Hugging Face model hub (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`). Alternatively, it can be a local directory containing the model weights.
  
  - **model_args**: Additional positional arguments passed to the model’s `__init__()` method.
  
  - **config** (`PretrainedConfig`, optional): You can provide a custom configuration for the model instead of automatically loading one from the pretrained model.
  
  - **state_dict** (`Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, optional): A state dictionary for the model weights. You can load custom weights instead of the ones provided with the model.
  
  - **cache_dir** (`str` or `os.PathLike`, optional): If provided, the model will be cached in the specified directory.
  
  - **from_tf** (`bool`, optional, defaults to `False`): Set this to `True` if you want to load weights from a TensorFlow checkpoint instead of PyTorch.
  
  - **force_download** (`bool`, optional, defaults to `False`): Set to `True` if you want to force the model to be downloaded again, even if a cached version exists.
  
  - **proxies** (`Dict[str, str]`, optional): A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint.
  
  - **output_loading_info** (`bool`, optional, defaults to `False`): If `True`, also returns a dictionary containing any missing or unexpected keys and other information during the model loading process.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModelForMultipleChoice
  
  # Download and cache the model and configuration from huggingface.co.
  model = AutoModelForMultipleChoice.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')

  # You can also update the configuration while loading the model.
  model = AutoModelForMultipleChoice.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased', output_attentions=True)
  print(model.config.output_attentions)  # True
  
  # Load from a TensorFlow checkpoint (slower).
  config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained('./tf_model/bert_tf_model_config.json')
  model = AutoModelForMultipleChoice.from_pretrained('./tf_model/bert_tf_checkpoint.ckpt.index', from_tf=True, config=config)
  ```

  **Note**:  
  The `from_pretrained()` method loads both the architecture and weights of the model, allowing for transfer learning or direct use of the pretrained model.
