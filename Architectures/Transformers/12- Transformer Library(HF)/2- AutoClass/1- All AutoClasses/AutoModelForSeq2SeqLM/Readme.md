### `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`

#### Purpose:
The `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` class is a generic wrapper that helps you instantiate one of the available sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models in the Hugging Face library, each with its specific architecture for language modeling tasks. These include models such as BART, T5, Marian, and more.

This class is designed to be used in a way that abstracts away the specifics of the individual model classes. Instead of manually choosing and loading a particular sequence-to-sequence model, you can use `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` to automatically select the appropriate model based on the configuration file or the pretrained model identifier.

You **cannot** instantiate this class directly using `__init__()`. It must be initialized using either `from_pretrained()` or `from_config()`.

### Methods:

#### 1. `from_config(config)`
- **Purpose:** This method instantiates the appropriate model based on the configuration provided.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `config`: This is an instance of `PretrainedConfig`, which defines how the model should be configured.
- **How It Works:** Depending on the configuration class passed, the correct model is selected. For example:
  - `BartConfig`: `BartForConditionalGeneration`
  - `T5Config`: `T5ForConditionalGeneration`
  - `MBartConfig`: `MBartForConditionalGeneration`
  - etc.

**Example:**
```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

# Download configuration and instantiate model based on it.
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained('t5-base')
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_config(config)
```

> **Note:** Loading a model from its configuration only loads the configuration details and does **not** load the model weights. For loading the actual model weights, you should use `from_pretrained()`.

---

#### 2. `from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path, *model_args, **kwargs)`
- **Purpose:** This method instantiates the model from a pretrained model. It not only loads the model configuration but also loads the model weights from a pretrained checkpoint.
- **Parameters:**
  - `pretrained_model_name_or_path`: A string (model identifier) or path to the pretrained model (e.g., `t5-base` or a local directory containing the model weights).
  - `model_args`: Additional arguments that are passed to the modelâ€™s `__init__()` method.
  - `config`: Optionally, a configuration object to override the default configuration.
  - Other arguments (such as `cache_dir`, `force_download`, `from_tf`, etc.) are passed to modify the behavior of model loading (e.g., to specify download settings or handle TensorFlow weights).
  
**How It Works:** This method will attempt to load the model class based on the `pretrained_model_name_or_path` and use the configuration to load the corresponding model (e.g., T5, BART).

**Example:**
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

# Load the pretrained T5 model and its configuration
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained('t5-base')

# Optionally, you can load the model with additional configuration settings
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained('t5-base', output_attentions=True)

# Check the configuration
print(model.config.output_attentions)  # Output: True
```

---

### Configuration Classes:
When you use `from_config()` or `from_pretrained()`, the underlying model will be selected based on the configuration class, which specifies the model architecture. For example:

- **BART:** `BartForConditionalGeneration`
- **T5:** `T5ForConditionalGeneration`
- **MBart:** `MBartForConditionalGeneration`
- **Marian:** `MarianMTModel`
- **Blenderbot:** `BlenderbotForConditionalGeneration`
- **M2M100:** `M2M100ForConditionalGeneration`
- **ProphetNet:** `ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration`

---

### Summary:
- `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` is a generic wrapper that loads a sequence-to-sequence model using configuration or pretrained weights.
- It can automatically select and instantiate the correct model based on the configuration or checkpoint.
- Use `from_config()` to load a model based on the configuration.
- Use `from_pretrained()` to load a model with both its configuration and pretrained weights.
