### **DoLa Decoding (Decoding by Contrasting Layers)**

**DoLa Decoding** (Decoding by Contrasting Layers) is a contrastive decoding strategy that improves the factuality and reduces hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). This method is described in the ICLR 2024 paper titled "DoLa: Decoding by Contrasting Layers Improves Factuality in Large Language Models."

The core idea behind DoLa is to contrast the differences in logits obtained from the final transformer layers versus the earlier ones. This strategy helps amplify the factual knowledge localized to specific parts of the model, leading to improved factuality in the generated output.

### **Steps to Activate DoLa Decoding**:
1. **Set the `dola_layers` argument**: This can either be:
   - A string: "low" or "high" to contrast the logits from the lower or higher layers of the model.
   - A list of integers: These integers represent specific transformer layer indices (e.g., `[28, 30]`) for fine-grained control over which layers are contrasted.
   
2. **Set `repetition_penalty`**: It is recommended to set the `repetition_penalty` to **1.2** to reduce repetition during DoLa decoding.

### **Example Code for DoLa Decoding**:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, set_seed
import torch
from accelerate.test_utils.testing import get_backend

# Initialize tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("huggyllama/llama-7b")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("huggyllama/llama-7b", torch_dtype=torch.float16)

# Detect backend device (CUDA, CPU, XPU, MPS, etc.)
device, _, _ = get_backend() 
model.to(device)
set_seed(42)

# Define prompt text
text = "On what date was the Declaration of Independence officially signed?"

# Tokenize the prompt text
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").to(device)

# Vanilla greedy decoding
vanilla_output = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=50)
vanilla_response = tokenizer.batch_decode(vanilla_output[:, inputs.input_ids.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Vanilla Output:")
print(vanilla_response)

# DoLa decoding with contrasting higher layers (layers 16,18,...,30)
dola_high_output = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=50, dola_layers='high')
dola_high_response = tokenizer.batch_decode(dola_high_output[:, inputs.input_ids.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("\nDoLa Decoding with High Layers:")
print(dola_high_response)

# DoLa decoding with contrasting specific layers (layers 28 and 30)
dola_custom_output = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=50, dola_layers=[28, 30], repetition_penalty=1.2)
dola_custom_response = tokenizer.batch_decode(dola_custom_output[:, inputs.input_ids.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("\nDoLa Decoding with Custom Layers:")
print(dola_custom_response)
```

### **Explanation of Key Parameters**:
- **`dola_layers`**:
  - Can be set to `"low"` or `"high"` to contrast the logits from the lower or higher layers of the model.
  - Alternatively, you can specify a list of integers (e.g., `[28, 30]`) to select specific layers for contrast.
- **`repetition_penalty`**: A penalty applied to discourage repetitive sequences in the output, set to `1.2` to ensure diversity in the generated text.
  
### **Example Outputs**:

1. **Vanilla Greedy Decoding** (without DoLa):
   ```plaintext
   'The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776.\nWhat was the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence? The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4,'
   ```

2. **DoLa Decoding with High Layers (16, 18, ..., 30)**:
   ```plaintext
   'July 4, 1776, when the Continental Congress voted to separate from Great Britain. The 56 delegates to the Continental Congress signed the Declaration on August 2, 1776.'
   ```

3. **DoLa Decoding with Custom Layers (28, 30)**:
   ```plaintext
   'It was officially signed on 2 August 1776, when 56 members of the Second Continental Congress, representing the original 13 American colonies, voted unanimously for the resolution for independence. The 2'
   ```

### **How DoLa Works**:
- **Layer Contrasting**: By contrasting logits from different layers of the model (higher or lower layers), DoLa focuses on amplifying factual knowledge and minimizing hallucinated or incorrect information.
- **Factuality Enhancement**: DoLa improves factuality by ensuring that the output is more aligned with factual knowledge embedded in specific layers of the model.
  
### **Conclusion**:
DoLa decoding improves the factuality of generated text by contrasting logits from different layers of a transformer model. This method helps reduce hallucinations and enhances the truthfulness of the output, making it especially useful for tasks requiring precise and accurate information retrieval from large language models.
