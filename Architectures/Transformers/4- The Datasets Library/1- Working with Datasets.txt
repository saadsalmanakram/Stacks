How to Work with Datasets Not on the Hugging Face Hub

>> Working with Local and Remote Datasets

   If your dataset isn't on the Hugging Face Hub, don't worry! You can still use the `ðŸ¤— Datasets` library to load data from your computer or a remote server.

>> Loading Local Datasets

   Here's how you can load a local dataset using different formats:

   - CSV & TSV: Use `load_dataset("csv", data_files="my_file.csv")`
   - Text Files: Use `load_dataset("text", data_files="my_file.txt")`
   - JSON & JSON Lines: Use `load_dataset("json", data_files="my_file.json")`
   - Pickled DataFrames: Use `load_dataset("pandas", data_files="my_dataframe.pkl")`

For example, if you have a dataset in JSON format, you can load it like this:

python code

'''
from datasets import load_dataset

squad_it_dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="SQuAD_it-train.json", field="data")
'''

This code will load the training data from a file named `SQuAD_it-train.json`. The result is a `DatasetDict` object that contains a "train" split with all the data.

If you want to load both training and test data at once, you can pass a dictionary to the `data_files` argument:

python code

'''
data_files = {"train": "SQuAD_it-train.json", "test": "SQuAD_it-test.json"}
squad_it_dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files=data_files, field="data")
'''

This way, you have both splits in one object, making it easy to work with the entire dataset.

>> Loading Remote Datasets

   If your dataset is stored online, you can load it just as easily. Instead of using local file paths, provide the URLs directly:

python code

'''
url = "https://github.com/crux82/squad-it/raw/master/"
data_files = {
    "train": url + "SQuAD_it-train.json.gz",
    "test": url + "SQuAD_it-test.json.gz",
}
squad_it_dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files=data_files, field="data")
'''

This code downloads the data from the provided URLs and loads it into the same `DatasetDict` format.

>> Key Points to Remember

   - You can load datasets in various formats like CSV, JSON, and more.
   - You can load data from local files or directly from URLs.
   - The `load_dataset()` function handles everything, including automatic decompression of files like `.gz` or `.zip`.
  
Once your dataset is loaded, you're ready to start processing and analyzing it!
