1- PHP

   CakePHP is a PHP framework, so PHP must be installed on your system.

   - Check if PHP is installed:

     php -v

   - Check installed PHP extensions: CakePHP requires certain PHP extensions to function, such as mbstring, intl, pdo, and openssl. To check installed PHP extensions:

     php -m

     Ensure that the following extensions are enabled:

     - mbstring
     - intl
     - pdo
     - openssl
     - curl (if needed for some functionality)
  

   - Install missing PHP extensions: For Ubuntu, you can install the missing extensions using:

     sudo apt-get install php-mbstring php-intl php-pdo php-openssl

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP)

   CakePHP is installed via Composer, a PHP dependency manager.

   - Check if Composer is installed:
   
     composer -v

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

3- Web Server (Apache/Nginx)
 
   CakePHP requires a web server like Apache or Nginx to serve your application.

   - Check if Apache is installed and running:

     apache2 -v

   - To check if the Apache service is running:

     sudo systemctl status apache2
 
   - Check if Nginx is installed and running (if using Nginx instead of Apache):

     nginx -v

   - To check if the Nginx service is running:

     sudo systemctl status nginx


(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- Database (MySQL/MariaDB)

   CakePHP commonly uses MySQL or MariaDB as its database system.

   - Check if MySQL is installed:

     mysql --version

   - Check if MariaDB is installed (if using MariaDB):

     mariadb --version

   - Check MySQL/MariaDB service status:

     sudo systemctl status mysql     # For MySQL
     sudo systemctl status mariadb   # For MariaDB


   If neither is installed, you can install MySQL or MariaDB using:

   - Install MySQL:

     sudo apt-get install mysql-server
 
   - Install MariaDB:

     sudo apt-get install mariadb-server

5- CakePHP

   CakePHP itself is installed via Composer.

   - Check if CakePHP is installed in your project: Navigate to your CakePHP project folder and check the installed packages:

     composer show cakephp/cakephp

   - Install CakePHP via Composer: If CakePHP is not installed, you can install it using Composer:

     composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app [app_name]

(--------------------------------------------------------------------------)

6- Other Required PHP Extensions

   You may also need additional extensions depending on your CakePHP application needs:

   - Check if gd (for image manipulation) is installed:

     php -m | grep gd

   - Check if pdo_mysql (for MySQL database connection) is installed:

     php -m | grep pdo_mysql


   If any of these are missing, you can install them using:

     sudo apt-get install php-gd php-pdo_mysql
