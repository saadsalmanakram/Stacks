# **Analyzing All Pandemics**

## **Introduction**

The **Analyzing All Pandemics** project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of historical and current pandemics through an interactive web application. Utilizing the **Django Stack** for the backend and **Next.js (React)** for the frontend, this application allows users to explore various pandemic data and statistical insights, enabling better understanding and preparedness for future outbreaks.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary goals of this project are to:
- **Visualize Pandemic Data**: Provide users with graphical representations of pandemic statistics over time.
- **Access Comprehensive Information**: Aggregate data from multiple sources to give a holistic view of pandemics.
- **Support Research and Education**: Serve as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and the public interested in pandemic history and statistics.

## **Features**

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Users can view and analyze pandemic data through various graphical formats.
- **Statistical Insights**: Access to statistics, trends, and comparisons among different pandemics.
- **Search and Filter Functionality**: Easily find specific pandemics or filter data based on various parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Next.js (React)** for an intuitive and responsive user experience.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Django Stack**

- **Django**: The backend framework that handles API requests, data processing, and server-side logic.
- **Python**: The programming language used for developing backend functionality.

### **Next.js (React)**

- Used for building the frontend, allowing for server-side rendering, static site generation, and an engaging user interface.

### **PostgreSQL**

- A powerful relational database management system used to store pandemic data efficiently. It supports complex queries and provides data integrity.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Analyzing All Pandemics** project follows a **MERN Stack** architecture where the backend (Django) communicates with the frontend (Next.js) and interacts with the PostgreSQL database. This design ensures efficient data handling and a responsive user experience.

### **System Components**

- **Django**: Manages server-side logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores pandemic data, including statistics and historical records.
- **Next.js (React)**: Provides the user interface for exploring pandemic data and accessing statistical insights.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you will need:
- **Python** (>= 3.8) and **pip** for managing Django dependencies.
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** for managing frontend dependencies.
- **PostgreSQL** for database management.
- Basic knowledge of **Django** and **React**.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/analyzing-all-pandemics.git
   cd analyzing-all-pandemics
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (Django)**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Set up the `.env` file for environment variables, including your PostgreSQL database connection.

3. **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Database Migration**:
   - Run migrations to set up the database schema:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

### **Running the Project**
