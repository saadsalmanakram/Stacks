# **Decentralized Deepfake Detection Network on Solana**

## **Introduction**

This repository implements a decentralized platform for detecting and verifying deepfake content using **Solana blockchain** for trust and transparency, combined with **Weaviate** for AI-powered detection algorithms. The frontend is developed using **Next.js (React)** for a smooth and interactive user experience. The project aims to leverage blockchain technology to verify media authenticity and create a transparent, decentralized deepfake detection network.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a decentralized network for detecting and verifying deepfake content.
- Use **Anchor Framework** for deploying smart contracts on **Solana**.
- Integrate **Weaviate** to store and search deepfake detection models.
- Provide a seamless interface using **Next.js (React)** for users to interact with the network and upload content for verification.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Anchor Framework**

The **Anchor Framework** is used for smart contract development on the **Solana blockchain**, providing:
- Secure, efficient smart contracts for decentralized deepfake detection.
- Transparent and trustless execution of deepfake verification processes.

### **Next.js (React)**

**Next.js (React)** powers the frontend, offering:
- A responsive and interactive interface for users to upload and verify media content.
- Real-time connection to the Solana blockchain for executing smart contracts.
- Seamless integration with the backend for managing detection workflows.

### **Weaviate**

**Weaviate** is an AI-powered vector search engine used to:
- Store and retrieve deepfake detection models.
- Power semantic search for deepfake detection algorithms.
- Manage model embeddings and enable fast similarity searches.

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The project architecture integrates **Solana** for decentralized processing, **Next.js** for user interaction, and **Weaviate** for managing deepfake detection models. 

### **System Components**

- **Solana Blockchain**: Handles transactions, deepfake verification, and ensures transparent execution of the detection workflow.
- **Anchor Framework**: Facilitates smart contracts that verify media content for authenticity and detect deepfakes in a decentralized manner.
- **Next.js (React)**: Provides the frontend for interacting with the platform, allowing users to upload media files, check results, and view transaction details.
- **Weaviate**: Manages AI models for detecting deepfakes, using semantic search and vector-based model storage for quick detection.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following before setting up:
- **Rust** and **Anchor Framework** for smart contract development.
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** for frontend development.
- **Weaviate** instance for AI model management.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decafake-detection-network.git
   cd decafake-detection-network
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (Anchor Framework)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cargo install --path .
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Weaviate Setup**:
   - Ensure **Weaviate** is running (locally or via a cloud instance).
   - Configure your **Weaviate** instance for storing deepfake detection models and handling search queries.

5. **Configure Solana**:
   - Set up your **Solana** wallet and update the necessary configuration in the `Anchor.toml` file.

6. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file and configure environment variables for **Solana**, **Weaviate**, and **Next.js** connections.

### **Running the Project**

1. **Run the Backend (Solana Smart Contracts)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   anchor build
   anchor deploy
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Ensure Weaviate** is running and connected for managing detection models.

## **Usage**

### **Submitting Content for Deepfake Detection**

- Users can upload media files (images, videos) to the platform for deepfake verification.
- Each submission triggers a **Solana** smart contract, which verifies the content using **Weaviate** deepfake detection models.

### **Transaction and Detection Workflow**

- Every media file submission is processed on-chain, with the **Anchor Framework** managing the transaction.
- Users can view the status of the verification process and check transaction details on the Solana blockchain.

### **Model Management with Weaviate**

- **Weaviate** manages deepfake detection models used for verifying media content.
- The detection process uses AI-powered models that are indexed using vector search, ensuring fast and accurate detection results.
