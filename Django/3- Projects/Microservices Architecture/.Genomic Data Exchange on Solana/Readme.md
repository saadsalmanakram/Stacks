# **Genomic Data Exchange on Solana**

## **Introduction**

The **Genomic Data Exchange on Solana** project provides a secure, decentralized platform for exchanging genomic data using blockchain technology. This platform is built on the **Solana blockchain** with **Anchor Framework** smart contracts to manage data exchange transactions, ensuring security and privacy. **Weaviate** is used for semantic search and advanced genomic data indexing, while the frontend is developed with **Next.js (React)** for seamless user interaction.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

This project aims to facilitate the decentralized exchange of sensitive genomic data, providing:
- **Security**: Using Solana blockchain’s decentralized and immutable architecture for safe data transactions.
- **Privacy**: Genomic data is securely encrypted, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it.
- **Data Integrity**: All data exchanges are recorded on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
- **Efficiency**: **Weaviate** powers fast and intelligent genomic data search and retrieval.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you need:
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** for frontend development.
- **Rust** and **Anchor Framework** for smart contract development.
- **Weaviate** for handling genomic data storage and search.
- **Solana** CLI for blockchain interactions.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genomic-data-exchange-solana.git
   cd genomic-data-exchange-solana
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (Anchor Framework)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cargo install --path .
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Weaviate Setup**:
   - Ensure you have a **Weaviate** instance running either locally or via a cloud service.
   - Configure **Weaviate** to handle genomic data indexing and retrieval.

5. **Solana Setup**:
   - Set up your **Solana** wallet and configure your environment for Solana.
   - Update the `Anchor.toml` file with the correct Solana program settings.

6. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file and set up all required environment variables for **Solana**, **Weaviate**, and **Next.js**.

### **Running the Project**

1. **Deploy the Backend (Solana + Anchor Framework)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   anchor build
   anchor deploy
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Ensure Weaviate is Running**:
   - Make sure your **Weaviate** instance is up and running, properly configured for genomic data management.
