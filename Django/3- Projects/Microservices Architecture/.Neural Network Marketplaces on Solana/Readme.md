# **Neural Network Marketplaces on Solana**

## **Introduction**

This repository implements a decentralized marketplace for neural network models on the **Solana blockchain**, built using the **Anchor Framework**, **Next.js (React)** for the frontend, and **Weaviate** for AI-powered neural network search and management. The marketplace allows users to buy, sell, and deploy neural network models securely and efficiently in a decentralized manner.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The goal of this project is to:
- Provide a decentralized marketplace for exchanging neural network models.
- Leverage the **Anchor Framework** for smart contract development on the **Solana blockchain**.
- Integrate **Weaviate** to power search and management of AI models using vector search.
- Build a seamless user interface using **Next.js (React)** for interaction with the marketplace.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Anchor Framework**

The **Anchor Framework** is used for building the **Solana** smart contracts that facilitate the marketplace transactions. It provides:
- Secure and efficient smart contract development.
- Integration with Solana’s runtime for fast transaction processing.
- Support for deploying and managing decentralized apps (dApps).

### **Next.js (React)**

The frontend is powered by **Next.js (React)**, which offers:
- A responsive and interactive UI for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- Server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO.
- Seamless integration with smart contracts for real-time updates.

### **Weaviate**

**Weaviate** is used as the vector search engine to:
- Index and search through neural network models using semantic search capabilities.
- Provide users with intelligent search and recommendation for the right neural network model based on their needs.
- Store vector embeddings of the models for fast retrieval and similarity matching.

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The system architecture consists of a **Solana blockchain** backend powered by the **Anchor Framework**, a **Next.js (React)** frontend for user interaction, and **Weaviate** for managing and searching AI models.

### **System Components**

- **Solana Blockchain**: The backbone of the decentralized marketplace, handling all transactions, purchases, and model exchanges.
- **Anchor Framework**: Manages the smart contracts deployed on Solana, ensuring secure and transparent interactions between buyers and sellers.
- **Next.js (React)**: Provides the user interface for the marketplace, allowing users to browse models, make transactions, and manage their marketplace interactions.
- **Weaviate**: Manages the search and discovery of neural network models using vector embeddings for fast and accurate search results.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:
- **Rust** and **Anchor Framework** for Solana development.
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) and **npm** or **yarn** for frontend development.
- **Weaviate** instance (local or cloud) for model search functionality.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-marketplace.git
   cd neural-network-marketplace
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies (Anchor Framework)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cargo install --path .
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Weaviate**:
   - Ensure you have a running **Weaviate** instance (local or hosted).
   - Configure your **Weaviate** connection details in the backend for searching models.

5. **Configure Solana**:
   - Set up a **Solana** wallet and update the `Anchor.toml` file with your Solana configuration.

6. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the necessary environment variables for Solana, Weaviate, and Next.js.

### **Running the Project**

1. **Run the Backend (Anchor Framework)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   anchor build
   anchor deploy
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Ensure Weaviate** is running for neural network model search.

## **Usage**

### **Neural Network Marketplace**

- Users can list their neural network models for sale, specifying model details, pricing, and deployment options.
- Buyers can browse available models, check out their specifications, and purchase them using **Solana** tokens.

### **Solana Transactions**

- All purchases, model uploads, and transactions are securely processed on the **Solana blockchain** using smart contracts.
- The **Anchor Framework** handles the creation, execution, and settlement of these contracts.

### **Model Search with Weaviate**

- **Weaviate** powers the search functionality, allowing users to find neural network models based on semantic search.
- Users can search for models based on use case, performance metrics, or other relevant factors, and **Weaviate** provides accurate model recommendations.
