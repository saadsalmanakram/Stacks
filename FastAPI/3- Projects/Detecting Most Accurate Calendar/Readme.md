# **Detecting Most Accurate Calendar**

## **Introduction**

This repository implements a system for detecting the most accurate calendar events and schedules using a combination of the **FastAPI Stack**, **Next.js (React)**, and **Cassandra** as the database. The application is designed to handle large-scale calendar data efficiently, providing users with precise event tracking and conflict resolution.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a backend that efficiently handles complex calendar data.
- Use **FastAPI** for rapid, high-performance APIs.
- Leverage **Next.js** for building a responsive and interactive frontend.
- Store and retrieve calendar data using **Cassandra**, ensuring high availability and scalability for large datasets.

## **Features**

- **Accurate Event Detection**: Efficiently detect and manage multiple calendar events with overlapping times and conflicts.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically identify and resolve scheduling conflicts, suggesting the most accurate event timings.
- **Large-Scale Data Handling**: Handle extensive calendar data with **Cassandra**, ensuring high scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Frontend UI**: Built using **Next.js (React)** for a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## **Tech Stack**

### **FastAPI Stack**

**FastAPI** is used to build the backend API that handles calendar event data. It provides:
- High performance and efficiency for handling real-time calendar data processing.
- Integration with **Cassandra** for fast and scalable data storage.
- Easy-to-use API documentation and fast response times.

### **Next.js (React)**

**Next.js** powers the frontend, offering:
- A responsive and interactive interface for users to create, edit, and manage calendar events.
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO.
- Seamless integration with the FastAPI backend for real-time updates.

### **Cassandra**

**Cassandra** is a NoSQL database designed for distributed data storage across many servers, providing:
- High availability with no single point of failure.
- Scalable storage and fast querying for large datasets of calendar events and schedules.
- Fault tolerance to handle data replication across multiple nodes.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

This system architecture consists of a **FastAPI** backend that manages calendar data, a **Next.js** frontend for user interaction, and **Cassandra** as the backend database to store and manage event records.

### **System Components**

- **Backend**: The **FastAPI** server handles API requests, processes calendar data, and communicates with the **Cassandra** database to store event details.
- **Frontend**: The **Next.js** interface allows users to create, manage, and visualize their calendar events and any detected conflicts.
- **Database**: **Cassandra** stores and retrieves calendar events, ensuring efficient data replication and access.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

Before setting up, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+** (for FastAPI)
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher for Next.js)
- **Cassandra** (local or cloud instance)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for frontend)

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/detect-accurate-calendar.git
   cd detect-accurate-calendar
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Cassandra**:
   - Make sure **Cassandra** is installed and running on your local machine or accessible via a cloud provider.
   - Create a keyspace and necessary tables for storing calendar data.

5. **Configure Backend**:
   - Update your **Cassandra** connection details in the `config.py` file for FastAPI.

6. **Configure Frontend**:
   - Update any necessary environment variables in the `.env.local` file for **Next.js**.

### **Running the Project**

1. **Run the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Ensure Cassandra** is up and running to store event data.

## **Usage**

### **Calendar Event Detection**

- Users can create and input calendar events using the **Next.js** interface. Each event includes the event title, time, date, and description.
- **FastAPI** processes the input and stores it in **Cassandra**.

### **Conflict Resolution**

- The system automatically checks for overlapping or conflicting calendar events.
- In case of a conflict, the backend suggests adjustments or resolves the conflict by marking the most accurate event.

### **Calendar Management**

- Users can view all scheduled events, check for conflicts, and manage their calendars through the frontend.
- **Cassandra** ensures fast access to past, present, and future events across distributed nodes.
