1- Flutter SDK

   First, ensure that the Flutter SDK is installed on your system.

   - Check if Flutter is installed:

     flutter --version

   
(----------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- Dart SDK

   Flutter apps are written in the Dart programming language, which is bundled with the Flutter SDK.

   - Check if Dart is installed (included with Flutter):
 
     dart --version

(---------------------------------------------------------------------------)

3- Android Studio (for Android development)
 
   For Android development, you need to have Android Studio and related components like Android SDK and device emulators installed.

   - Check if Android Studio is installed:

     android-studio --version

   Alternatively, check if it exists in your applications or by running:

     which studio.sh

   - Check Android SDK installation:

     sdkmanager --list

   
   If you do not have Android Studio or Android SDK installed, you can download Android Studio from here.

   - Check if ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is installed:

     adb --version

   - If ADB is missing, you can install it using:

     sudo apt-get install adb  # For Linux/Ubuntu
     brew install android-platform-tools  # For macOS


(----------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- Emulators (Android/IOS)
  
   - Check if Android Emulator is installed:

     flutter emulators

If you don't have an emulator, you can create one via Android Studio:

 1- Open Android Studio.
 2- Navigate to Tools > AVD Manager.
 3- Create a new emulator.

   - Check if iOS Simulator is installed (for macOS/iOS development):

     open -a Simulator

(----------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- Flutter Doctor (Comprehensive Check)

   Flutter provides a built-in tool called flutter doctor to check the status of your development environment.

   - Run Flutter Doctor:

     flutter doctor

This command checks:

- Flutter SDK installation.
- Dart SDK installation.
- Android Studio installation (if developing for Android).
- Xcode installation (if developing for iOS).
- Device emulators (Android/iOS).
- Any missing dependencies.
