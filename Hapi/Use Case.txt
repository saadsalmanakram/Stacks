Steps to Build a Hapi Stack Application

1. Set Up the Development Environment:
   - Install Node.js and NPM on your machine.
   - Set up a text editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code or WebStorm.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project and install Hapi.js using npm.

2. Create a Basic Hapi.js Server:
   - Set up a basic server with Hapi.js by creating a server instance and defining routes.
   - Configure the server with necessary plugins and middlewares, including logging, authentication, and error handling.

3. Design and Develop the API:
   - Design the API endpoints that your application will expose.
   - Implement the logic for handling requests and responses using Hapi.js route handlers.
   - Validate incoming data using Joi and handle errors gracefully with Boom.

4. Integrate with a Database:
   - Set up a connection to your chosen database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).
   - Use ORMs like Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for SQL databases) to interact with the database.
   - Implement CRUD operations and complex queries as required by your application.

5. Develop the Front-End (Optional):
   - If building a full-stack application, set up the front-end using Angular, React, or Vue.
   - Develop the user interface and connect it to the Hapi.js back-end via

 API calls.
   - Use state management libraries like Redux (for React) or Vuex (for Vue) if necessary.

6. Test the Application:
   - Write unit and integration tests using Lab and Code to ensure your application works as expected.
   - Run tests regularly and fix any issues that arise.
   - Ensure that the application meets performance and security standards.

7. Optimize and Secure the Application:
   - Implement security best practices like input sanitization, authentication, and HTTPS.
   - Optimize the server and database queries for performance.
   - Monitor the application using logging tools and performance monitoring services.

8. Deploy the Application:
   - Prepare your application for deployment by bundling and minifying assets.
   - Deploy the back-end to a server or cloud platform and configure the environment variables.
   - Deploy the front-end (if applicable) to a hosting platform and ensure it connects correctly to the back-end.

9. Monitor and Maintain the Application:
   - Set up monitoring tools to track performance, errors, and usage.
   - Regularly update dependencies and the application to fix bugs and add new features.
   - Maintain a robust backup and disaster recovery plan.
