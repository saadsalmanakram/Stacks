# **OS Live Analytics Using Kivy**

## **Introduction**

The **OS Live Analytics Using Kivy** project aims to provide real-time analytics and monitoring of operating system metrics through an interactive graphical interface. Utilizing the **Kivy** framework for the user interface and **SQLite** for data storage, this application allows users to visualize system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk activity, and network statistics.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary goals of this project are to:
- **Monitor System Metrics**: Provide real-time monitoring of critical OS metrics.
- **Visualize Data**: Enable users to visualize performance data through graphs and charts.
- **Support System Administration**: Serve as a valuable tool for system administrators and enthusiasts to analyze and troubleshoot system performance.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Kivy**

- A Python framework for developing multitouch applications. It provides a flexible and powerful interface for building the graphical user interface of this application.

### **SQLite**

- A lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine used to store system metrics and historical data efficiently.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **OS Live Analytics Using Kivy** project follows a client-side architecture where the Kivy application interacts with the operating system to gather metrics and store them in an SQLite database for visualization and analysis.

### **System Components**

- **Kivy**: Manages the user interface and handles real-time updates of system metrics.
- **SQLite**: Stores historical performance data for analysis and retrieval.
- **Python**: The programming language used for both the backend data collection and the frontend application logic.
