# **Recognizing Humans Based on Posture**

## **Introduction**

The **Recognizing Humans Based on Posture** project aims to leverage computer vision techniques to recognize and analyze human postures using Vision Transformers. This web application, built with the **Laravel Stack** for the backend and **Next.js (React)** for the frontend, allows users to upload images or stream video and receive real-time posture recognition results. The system is designed to assist in various applications, including fitness tracking, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary goals of this project are to:
- **Recognize Human Postures**: Utilize Vision Transformers to analyze and classify human postures from images or video streams.
- **Provide Real-Time Feedback**: Allow users to receive instant feedback on their posture through an intuitive interface.
- **Support Research and Development**: Serve as a foundation for researchers and developers interested in posture recognition and related fields.

## **Features**

- **Posture Recognition**: Analyze and classify human postures using Vision Transformers.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provide users with instant feedback on their posture.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Next.js (React)** for a responsive and engaging user experience.
- **Data Storage**: Store user-uploaded images and recognition results in a MySQL database for historical analysis.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Laravel Stack**

- **Laravel**: The backend framework that manages server-side logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
- **PHP**: The programming language used for developing backend functionality.

### **Next.js (React)**

- Used for building the frontend, allowing for server-side rendering, static site generation, and an engaging user interface.

### **MySQL**

- A popular relational database management system used to store user data, posture recognition results, and other relevant information.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Recognizing Humans Based on Posture** project follows a client-server architecture where the backend (Laravel) processes requests and communicates with the frontend (Next.js) to provide a seamless user experience. The MySQL database stores all relevant data for efficient access and retrieval.

### **System Components**

- **Laravel**: Manages server-side logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Stores user-uploaded images, recognition results, and historical data.
- **Next.js (React)**: Provides the user interface for uploading images, displaying results, and user interaction.
