# **Species Taxonomy Breakdown**

## **Introduction**

The **Species Taxonomy Breakdown** project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis and visualization of species taxonomy across different biological classifications. Leveraging the **Laravel Stack** for the backend and **Next.js (React)** for the frontend, this application allows users to explore species data through an interactive interface, making it easier to understand the relationships and hierarchies in biological classification.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary goals of this project are to:
- **Visualize Species Taxonomy**: Provide an intuitive interface for users to explore and understand species classifications.
- **Store and Retrieve Data**: Use **MySQL** for efficient storage and retrieval of taxonomy data.
- **Enhance Learning**: Support educational initiatives by offering a tool for learning about species classification.

## **Features**

- **Interactive Taxonomy Visualization**: Users can view and explore the hierarchical relationships of species.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find species based on name, classification, or other attributes.
- **Detailed Species Information**: Access in-depth information about each species, including characteristics and classifications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Next.js (React)** for a seamless user experience.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Laravel Stack**

- **Laravel**: The backend framework that handles API requests, user authentication, and business logic.
- **PHP**: The programming language used for developing the backend logic of the application.

### **Next.js (React)**

- Used for building the frontend, allowing for server-side rendering, static site generation, and a responsive user interface.

### **MySQL**

- A relational database management system used to store species taxonomy data efficiently. It supports complex queries and relationships among data.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Species Taxonomy Breakdown** project follows a **MERN Stack** architecture where the backend (Laravel) communicates with the frontend (Next.js) and interacts with the MySQL database. This setup ensures efficient data handling and a responsive user experience.

### **System Components**

- **Laravel**: Manages server-side logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Stores species data, classifications, and relationships.
- **Next.js (React)**: Provides the user interface for visualizing taxonomy and accessing species information.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you will need:
- **PHP** (>= 7.4) and **Composer** for managing Laravel dependencies.
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** for managing frontend dependencies.
- **MySQL** for database management.
- Basic knowledge of **Laravel** and **React**.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/species-taxonomy-breakdown.git
   cd species-taxonomy-breakdown
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (Laravel)**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     composer install
     ```
   - Set up the `.env` file and configure your MySQL database connection.

3. **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Database Migration**:
   - Run migrations to set up the database schema:
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     ```

### **Running the Project**

1. **Start the Backend (Laravel)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
