# **Ethnicity Teller Based on Features**

## **Introduction**

The **Ethnicity Teller Based on Features** project aims to classify a person's ethnicity based on facial features using advanced **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. Developed with the **MEAN stack**, this web application allows users to upload images and receive predictions about the ethnicity of individuals in the images. The application leverages a **MongoDB** database for storing user data, images, and prediction results.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary objectives of this project are to:
- **Ethnicity Classification**: Utilize CNNs to accurately classify and predict ethnicity based on facial features.
- **User Engagement**: Provide an interactive platform for users to upload images and receive classification results.
- **Data Management**: Store user uploads and prediction results in a MongoDB database for future reference and analysis.

## **Features**

- **Ethnicity Classification**: Accurately detects and classifies ethnicities from facial images using CNN models.
- **Interactive Uploads**: Users can upload images for real-time ethnicity classification.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays results in a user-friendly format, including confidence scores for each predicted ethnicity.
- **Data Storage**: Uses MongoDB to store user uploads, classification results, and historical data.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **MEAN Stack**

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user data, images, and prediction results.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that provides routing and middleware support.
- **Angular**: A platform for building web applications that allows for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for server-side scripting.

### **Convolutional Neural Networks**

- A type of deep learning model specifically designed for image processing tasks, particularly effective in recognizing patterns and features in visual data.

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Ethnicity Teller** follows a client-server architecture where the Angular front end interacts with the Express.js backend. The backend processes user input, runs the ethnicity classification using CNNs, and stores results in a MongoDB database.

### **System Components**

- **Angular**: Manages the user interface and user interactions.
- **Express.js**: Handles API requests and serves as the middleware between the front end and the database.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user data, images, and classification results.
- **CNNs**: Used for detecting and classifying ethnicities based on facial features in the uploaded images.

   cd ethnicity-teller
   ```

2. **Install Server Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the server directory and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Client Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the client directory and install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Database Setup**:
   - Set up your MongoDB instance and update the connection string in the server configuration file.

### **Running the Project**

- Start the server:
  ```bash

## **Usage**

### **Ethnicity Classification Process**

- Users can upload an image through the interface.
- The application processes the input using CNNs and returns the predicted ethnicity along with confidence scores.

### **User Interaction**

- The interactive dashboard allows users to see classification results, including visual feedback on the detected features that influenced the ethnicity classification.
