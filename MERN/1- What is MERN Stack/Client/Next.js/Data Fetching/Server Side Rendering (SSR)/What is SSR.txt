> Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

- What it is: Data is fetched on every request and the page is rendered on the server for each incoming request. It results in fresh data being fetched each time.

- When to use it: Use SSR when you need the data to be up-to-date with every request, such as with user-specific content, dashboards, or pages with constantly changing data.

> Pros:

  - Always returns the most up-to-date data.
  - Good for pages where data changes frequently or where you need to fetch user-specific data.

> Cons:

  - Slower than SSG because the page is re-rendered on every request.
  - Can increase server load, as rendering happens for every request.
