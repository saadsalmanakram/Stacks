# **Animal Detection Based on Their Postures**

## **Introduction**

The **Animal Detection Based on Their Postures** project is a web application designed to detect and analyze various animal postures using advanced computer vision techniques. By leveraging the power of the **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) model and the **MERN** stack, this application enables users to identify and visualize animals based on their physical stances in real-time.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

This project aims to:
- **Enhance Animal Recognition**: Facilitate accurate identification of different animal species based on their postures.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Provide a user-friendly interface for detecting and displaying animals as they are observed in various environments.
- **Utilize Modern Technologies**: Employ state-of-the-art machine learning models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of animal detection.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Animal Detection**: Utilize the YOLO model for fast and accurate animal posture recognition.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can upload images or stream video feeds for immediate detection and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Display detected animals along with bounding boxes and posture analysis results.
- **Database Storage**: Store detected results and user interactions in MongoDB for future reference.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Backend**

- **MERN Stack**: The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, providing a RESTful API to manage animal detection processes and user data.

### **Frontend**

- **Next.js (React)**: The frontend leverages Next.js for creating a responsive and dynamic user interface, featuring server-side rendering for improved performance.

### **Computer Vision**

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: A real-time object detection system that allows for the quick identification of animals based on their postures.

### **Database**

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data, detection results, and related metadata efficiently.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Animal Detection Based on Their Postures** project employs a client-server architecture, where the frontend communicates with the backend via API requests. The YOLO model processes images or video streams to identify and analyze animal postures.

### **System Components**

- **Node.js & Express**: Handles backend logic and API requests for animal detection.
- **Next.js**: Responsible for the frontend user interface, providing a smooth user experience.
- **YOLO Model**: Performs real-time detection and classification of animals based on their postures.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user data, detection logs, and other relevant information.
