# **Quantum Resistant Secure Messaging Platform on Solana**

## **Introduction**

This repository provides the codebase for a **Quantum Resistant Secure Messaging Platform** built on the **Solana blockchain**. It integrates **quantum-resistant encryption algorithms** with a decentralized messaging framework to ensure the highest level of security and privacy for communications. The platform leverages **Weaviate** for advanced message indexing and retrieval, while the frontend interface is developed using **Next.js (React)** to provide an intuitive user experience.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary objectives of this project include:
- Building a secure, decentralized messaging system that is resilient against quantum computing threats.
- Utilizing the **Anchor Framework** to deploy smart contracts on the **Solana blockchain** for managing secure message transactions.
- Integrating **Weaviate** for efficient and intelligent message storage and retrieval.
- Providing a simple and effective **Next.js (React)** interface for users to send and receive secure messages.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following before setting up the project:
- **Rust** and **Anchor Framework** for smart contract development.
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** for frontend development.
- **Weaviate** instance for AI-powered message management.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-secure-messaging-platform.git
   cd quantum-secure-messaging-platform
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (Anchor Framework)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cargo install --path .
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Weaviate Setup**:
   - Ensure **Weaviate** is up and running either locally or via a cloud instance.
   - Configure **Weaviate** for handling secure message storage and retrieval.

5. **Solana Configuration**:
   - Set up your **Solana** wallet and configure the smart contract settings in the `Anchor.toml` file.

6. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file and set up all required environment variables for **Solana**, **Weaviate**, and **Next.js**.

### **Running the Project**

1. **Deploy the Backend (Solana + Anchor Framework)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   anchor build
   anchor deploy
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Ensure Weaviate is Running**:
   - Check that your **Weaviate** instance is running and properly connected to handle secure message data.

## **Usage**

### **Sending Secure Messages**

- Users can send messages through the platform interface. Each message is encrypted using quantum-resistant encryption methods.
- The encrypted message is stored on the **Solana blockchain**, ensuring tamper-proof security.

### **Quantum-Resistant Encryption Workflow**

- All messages are encrypted with algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.
- The **Anchor Framework** smart contracts manage encryption, decryption, and message storage in a decentralized way.

### **Message Retrieval and Management with Weaviate**

- Messages are stored and indexed in **Weaviate**.
- The platform supports fast and secure retrieval of encrypted messages through **Weaviate's** semantic search capabilities.
