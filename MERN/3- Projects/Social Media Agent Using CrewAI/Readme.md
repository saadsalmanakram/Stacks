# **Social Media Agent Using CrewAI**

## **Introduction**

This repository provides an implementation of a **Social Media Agent** built using **CrewAI**, **Next.js (React)**, and **Weaviate**. The agent automates interactions on social media platforms by generating content, responding to messages, and analyzing trends using AI-powered models. This solution is designed to streamline social media management for businesses, influencers, and individuals.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The purpose of this project is to:
- Automate content creation and social media engagement using **CrewAI**.
- Build a responsive and interactive frontend using **Next.js**.
- Use **Weaviate**, a vector search engine, to analyze data and generate insights.

## **Tech Stack**

### **CrewAI**

CrewAI is an AI-powered automation framework that helps build and deploy intelligent agents. For this project, it is used to manage content generation and automatic replies on social media platforms.

- **Key Features**:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) for generating human-like content.
  - AI-based decision-making for responses.
  - Integration with social media APIs.

### **Next.js (React)**

Next.js is a React-based framework used for building the frontend of the Social Media Agent. It supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), which ensures a fast and SEO-friendly user interface.

- **Key Features**:
  - Server-side rendering for improved performance.
  - Easy integration with APIs to manage social media data.
  - Responsive and interactive UI for managing content and engagement.

### **Weaviate**

Weaviate is an open-source vector search engine that is used in this project to analyze and retrieve relevant data from social media platforms. It helps the agent identify trends, keywords, and topics by comparing vector representations of social media data.

- **Key Features**:
  - Efficient vector-based search for data insights.
  - Scalable for large datasets.
  - Integrated machine learning modules for data classification and clustering.

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The Social Media Agent follows a modular architecture, separating the **AI components** (CrewAI), **frontend user interface** (Next.js), and **data analysis engine** (Weaviate) into distinct layers.

### **System Components**

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js (React), the frontend allows users to configure social media accounts, schedule posts, and view engagement statistics.
- **Backend**: CrewAI is responsible for generating content, posting updates, and responding to messages in real-time.
- **Data Analysis**: Weaviate stores and processes social media data, allowing the agent to analyze trends and provide recommendations.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Docker** (for running Weaviate)
- **CrewAI Account** (for API access)
  
### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-agent-crewai.git
   cd social-media-agent-crewai
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up CrewAI API**:
   - Obtain your API key from CrewAI and set it in the `.env` file.

4. **Set Up Weaviate**:
   - Start Weaviate using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 8080:8080 semitechnologies/weaviate:latest
     ```

5. **Configure Social Media API Keys**:
   - Obtain API keys from the social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and add them to the `.env` file.

### **Running the Project**

1. **Run the Next.js Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Run the Backend AI Agent**:
   - Ensure CrewAI is integrated and connected by running the agent through the backend.

3. **Start Weaviate for Data Analysis**:
   - Ensure Weaviate is running in Docker for social media data vectorization and trend analysis.

## **Usage**

### **Configuring Social Media Platforms**
- Navigate to the settings section in the frontend to add and configure social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Facebook).
- Add API keys and define posting rules (e.g., post frequency, content type).

### **Generating Content**
- Use the "Generate Content" tab to automatically create new posts using CrewAI’s NLP capabilities.
- Review and edit content before scheduling or posting it directly to social media platforms.

### **Analyzing Social Media Trends**
- Go to the "Trends" section to analyze engagement metrics and keyword trends.
- Weaviate will display insights from your social media data, helping you make data-driven content decisions.
