# **Typing Improvement System Using Deep Learning**

## **Introduction**

The **Typing Improvement System** is designed to help users enhance their typing skills through personalized feedback and adaptive training powered by **Deep Learning** models. Built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it combines the efficiency of a modern web framework with the power of AI for real-time analysis and improvement suggestions.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary objective of this project is to:
- **Improve typing speed and accuracy** through dynamic exercises.
- **Track progress** with personalized metrics and insights.
- **Leverage Deep Learning** for providing adaptive feedback based on users' performance.

## **Tech Stack**

### **MERN Stack**

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store user data, performance metrics, and training progress.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework to handle API requests and communication between the client and server.
- **React (Next.js)**: Frontend framework to deliver an interactive and engaging user interface.
- **Node.js**: Server environment for executing JavaScript on the backend.

### **Next.js (React)**

- Used for building the frontend, providing dynamic routing, server-side rendering, and performance optimization.

### **MongoDB**

- A document-based database that stores user profiles, typing metrics, and training data. It is highly scalable and perfect for real-time data tracking.

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Typing Improvement System** consists of a **MERN Stack** architecture. The system processes typing input from users and provides real-time feedback using AI models. All data is securely stored in **MongoDB**, while the frontend, built with **Next.js (React)**, ensures a smooth and interactive user experience.

### **System Components**

- **MongoDB**: Stores user information and performance data.
- **Express.js**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and the backend.
- **React (Next.js)**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the typing trainer.
- **Node.js**: Executes backend operations, such as running the AI model and managing data flow.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you’ll need:
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** for managing dependencies.
- **MongoDB** instance for storing user data.
- Basic knowledge of **React** and **Express** for frontend and backend setup.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typing-improvement-system-dl.git
   cd typing-improvement-system-dl
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (Express and MongoDB)**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - Set up MongoDB and update the `config.js` file with your MongoDB URI.

3. **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in both the frontend and backend directories and add the necessary environment variables for your MongoDB and Next.js configurations.

### **Running the Project**

1. **Start the Backend (Express.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
