# **Unified Cancer Detection System**

## **Introduction**

The **Unified Cancer Detection System** is a comprehensive web application designed to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection of various types of cancer through advanced image analysis. By utilizing a combination of **Machine Learning** techniques, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, and a robust web technology stack (MERN), this application aims to streamline the diagnostic process and enhance patient outcomes.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary goals of this project are to:
- **Cancer Detection**: Provide accurate analysis and detection of cancerous cells in medical images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive platform for healthcare professionals to upload and analyze images.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Deliver quick and reliable results to aid in the diagnosis process.

## **Features**

- **Image Analysis**: Analyzes medical images to detect various cancer types using trained CNN models.
- **Real-Time Results**: Provides immediate feedback on the analysis, allowing for timely decision-making.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: A clean and intuitive interface for users to upload images and view results.
- **Data Management**: Efficiently handles user data and image storage using MongoDB.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Backend**

- **MERN Stack**: The backend utilizes **Node.js** and **Express.js** to create RESTful APIs that handle requests and manage data flow.

### **Frontend**

- **Next.js (React)**: A powerful framework that enhances the user interface, allowing for server-side rendering and dynamic routing.

### **Machine Learning**

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Implemented for image classification and cancer detection, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for model training and inference.

### **Database**

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data, images, and analysis results efficiently.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Unified Cancer Detection System** is structured around a client-server architecture where the frontend communicates with the backend APIs. The CNN models perform image analysis, and the results are returned to the user interface for display.

### **System Components**

- **Node.js & Express**: Handles backend logic and API requests.
- **Next.js**: Manages the frontend user interface and interactions.
- **CNN Model**: Analyzes medical images for cancer detection.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user data, uploaded images, and analysis results.
