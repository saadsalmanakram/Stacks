## **Tech Stack**

### **Backend**

- **MERN Stack**: The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, providing a RESTful API to manage user interactions and vehicle data.

### **Frontend**

- **Next.js (React)**: Utilizes the Next.js framework for building a dynamic and responsive user interface with server-side rendering capabilities.

### **Generative AI**

- **AI Algorithms**: Implemented to facilitate shape generation and modification, allowing for creative and unique vehicle designs based on user preferences.

### **Database**

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user profiles, modified vehicle shapes, and design metadata efficiently.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Vehicle Shape Modification System** operates on a client-server architecture, where the frontend interacts with the backend through APIs. The Generative AI model processes user inputs and generates vehicle designs that are then displayed in real-time.

### **System Components**

- **Node.js & Express**: Manages backend logic and API requests for vehicle shape modifications.
- **Next.js**: Responsible for the frontend user interface, providing a seamless experience for users.
- **Generative AI Model**: Analyzes user inputs and generates vehicle shapes using advanced algorithms.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user data, design configurations, and history of modifications.
