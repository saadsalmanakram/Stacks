# **Movie Emotion Analyzer using Vision Transformers**

## **Introduction**

The **Movie Emotion Analyzer** project aims to analyze and interpret the emotions depicted in movie scenes using advanced **Vision Transformer** models. This web application, developed with the **MEVN stack**, provides users with a platform to upload movie clips or images and receive emotion analysis based on the visual content. The application utilizes a **MongoDB** database for storing movie data, user inputs, and analysis results.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary objectives of this project are to:
- **Emotion Detection**: Utilize Vision Transformers to accurately detect and classify emotions from movie scenes.
- **User Engagement**: Allow users to interactively upload and analyze movie content, fostering a deeper understanding of emotional expression in film.
- **Data Management**: Store analyzed data in a MongoDB database for efficient retrieval and analysis.

## **Features**

- **Emotion Detection**: Accurately detects emotions from movie clips or images using Vision Transformers.
- **Interactive Uploads**: Users can upload movie clips or stills for real-time emotion analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays results in an easy-to-understand format, including emotion distribution graphs.
- **Data Storage**: Uses MongoDB to store user uploads, analysis results, and historical data for future reference.

## **Tech Stack**

### **MEVN Stack**

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user data, movie clips, and analysis results.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that provides robust routing and middleware support.
- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, enabling interactive front-end development.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for server-side scripting.

### **Vision Transformers**

- A type of deep learning model that has shown state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks, particularly in image classification and emotion detection.

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Movie Emotion Analyzer** follows a client-server architecture where the Vue.js front end interacts with the Express.js backend. The backend processes user input, runs the emotion analysis using Vision Transformers, and stores results in a MongoDB database.

### **System Components**

- **Vue.js**: Manages the user interface and user interactions.
- **Express.js**: Handles API requests and serves as the middleware between the front end and the database.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user data, movie clips, and analysis results.
- **Vision Transformers**: Used for detecting and classifying emotions in the uploaded movie content.
