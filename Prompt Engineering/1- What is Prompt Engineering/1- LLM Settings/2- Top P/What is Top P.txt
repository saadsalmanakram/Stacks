Nucleus sampling is a method that lets you control how predictable or creative the modelâ€™s responses are. If you want accurate, straightforward answers, you should keep the "temperature" low. But if you want more variety in the responses, you can set it higher. When using "Top P," only the most likely words are considered for the response. A low Top P value gives you more certain answers, while a high Top P allows the model to explore more options, including less likely ones, which leads to more diverse and creative answers.
