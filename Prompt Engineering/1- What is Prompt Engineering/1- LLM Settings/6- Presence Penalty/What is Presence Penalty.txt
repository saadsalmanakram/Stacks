The presence penalty helps reduce the repetition of words or phrases in the model's responses. It treats all repeated words equally, meaning whether a word shows up two times or ten times, it gets penalized the same way. This helps avoid the model from overusing certain phrases. If you want the model to create more varied or creative text, you can set a higher presence penalty. On the other hand, if you want the model to stick to specific topics or ideas, a lower presence penalty might be better.
