In working with language models, the quality of your results heavily relies on how you craft your prompts. A well-structured prompt provides the model with clear instructions, context, and examples, allowing it to generate more accurate and relevant responses. For instance, instead of asking a vague question, you can specify what kind of information youâ€™re looking for.

Example Prompt

1. **Reading a book** - Find a cozy spot, grab a blanket, and immerse yourself in a good story.  
2. **Cooking or baking** - Try out new recipes or bake your favorite treats.  
3. **Watching movies** - Have a movie marathon with your favorite films or series.  
4. **Indoor games** - Play board games or card games with family or friends.  
5. **Crafting** - Get creative with some DIY projects or arts and crafts.
