# Meta Prompting

## Introduction
Meta Prompting is an advanced prompting technique that emphasizes the structural and syntactical aspects of tasks and problems rather than their specific content details. The goal of meta prompting is to construct a more abstract, structured way of interacting with large language models (LLMs), focusing on form and pattern over traditional content-centric methods.

## Key Characteristics
According to Zhang et al. (2024), the key characteristics of meta prompting are:

1. **Structure-Oriented**: Prioritizes the format and pattern of problems and solutions over specific content.
2. **Syntax-Focused**: Uses syntax as a guiding template for the expected response or solution.
3. **Abstract Examples**: Employs abstracted examples as frameworks, illustrating the structure of problems and solutions without focusing on specific details.
4. **Versatile**: Applicable across various domains, capable of providing structured responses to a wide range of problems.
5. **Categorical Approach**: Draws from type theory to emphasize the categorization and logical arrangement of components in a prompt.

## Advantages over Few-Shot Prompting
Meta Prompting differs from few-shot prompting in that it focuses on a structure-oriented approach rather than a content-driven approach. Some key advantages include:

1. **Token Efficiency**: Reduces the number of tokens required by focusing on structure rather than detailed content.
2. **Fair Comparison**: Provides a more fair approach for comparing different problem-solving models by minimizing the influence of specific examples.
3. **Zero-Shot Efficacy**: Can be viewed as a form of zero-shot prompting, where the influence of specific examples is minimized.

## Example: Meta Prompting vs. Few-Shot Prompting

### Few-Shot Prompting Example
```
User: Solve the following math problem: If a train travels 60 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, how far does it travel?

LLM: Example 1: A car travels at 50 miles per hour for 3 hours. Distance = Speed × Time = 50 × 3 = 150 miles.
Example 2: A plane flies at 400 miles per hour for 1.5 hours. Distance = 400 × 1.5 = 600 miles.

Given this pattern, Train Distance = 60 × 2.5 = 150 miles.
```

### Meta Prompting Example
```
User: Solve the following math problem using structured reasoning:
[Problem: {Given variables: Speed (S), Time (T)}]
[Solution: {Apply formula: Distance (D) = S × T}]
[Final Answer: Compute value]

LLM: {Solution: {D = 60 × 2.5}}
{Final Answer: 150 miles}
```

Meta prompting ensures a structured approach that can be generalized across different types of problems.

## Applications
By focusing on structural patterns of problem-solving, Meta Prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs across various domains. Some applications include:

1. **Complex Reasoning Tasks**: Facilitates logical deductions and abstract problem-solving.
2. **Mathematical Problem-Solving**: Provides structured solutions to numerical and symbolic problems.
3. **Coding Challenges**: Assists in generating algorithmic solutions by focusing on syntax and structure.
4. **Theoretical Queries**: Helps organize information systematically for better comprehension.

## Implementation in Code
Below are some code examples demonstrating how to implement meta prompting in Python.

### Example 1: Using Meta Prompting for Math Problem Solving
```python
import openai

def meta_prompting_math(problem):
    prompt = f"""
    Solve the following problem using structured reasoning:
    [Problem: {{Given variables}}]
    [Solution: {{Apply formula}}]
    [Final Answer: Compute value]

    Problem: {problem}
    """
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

problem = "A car travels at 70 mph for 4 hours. How far does it go?"
print(meta_prompting_math(problem))
```

### Example 2: Using Meta Prompting for Code Generation
```python
def meta_prompting_code(task):
    prompt = f"""
    Generate a Python function to complete the following task:
    [Task: {{Description of functionality}}]
    [Structure: {{Define input, process, and output}}]
    [Implementation: {{Write code}}]

    Task: {task}
    """
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

task = "Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number."
print(meta_prompting_code(task))
```

## Conclusion
Meta Prompting represents a powerful shift from content-driven prompting to structure-driven prompting. By focusing on syntax, structure, and categorical organization, it enables more efficient and logical interactions with LLMs. This approach not only enhances token efficiency but also supports diverse applications, including mathematics, programming, and theoretical reasoning.
