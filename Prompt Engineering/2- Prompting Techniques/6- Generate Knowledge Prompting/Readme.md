# Generated Knowledge Prompting

## Overview

**Generated Knowledge Prompting** is a method designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating generated knowledge into the prompting process before making predictions. This technique, introduced by Liu et al. (2022), aims to address common knowledge gaps in LLMs and improve their accuracy in commonsense reasoning tasks.

### Why Use Knowledge Generation?

LLMs are powerful but often make errors due to incomplete world knowledge. By first generating relevant knowledge before answering a query, models can improve their reasoning ability. This is especially useful in tasks such as:

- Commonsense reasoning
- Fact-checking
- Logical inference
- Context-based question answering

## Methodology

The technique involves two main steps:

1. **Knowledge Generation:** Before answering a question, the model first generates relevant knowledge related to the input.
2. **Knowledge Integration & Answering:** The generated knowledge is then included in the prompt to guide the model towards an accurate response.

## Example Walkthrough

### **Baseline Prompt Without Knowledge**

**Prompt:**
```
Question: Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others. Yes or No?
```
**Model Output:**
```
Yes.
```

This response is incorrect because the goal of golf is to achieve the lowest score.

### **Step 1: Generate Knowledge**

Instead of answering directly, we first ask the model to generate relevant knowledge:

**Prompt:**
```
Input: Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others.
Knowledge:
```
**Model Output:**
```
Golf is a sport where the objective is to complete the course with the fewest strokes. Each stroke is counted as one point, and the player with the lowest total score wins.
```

### **Step 2: Integrate Knowledge into Answering**

Now, we reformulate the question and include the generated knowledge:

**Prompt:**
```
Question: Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others. Yes or No?
Knowledge: Golf is a sport where the objective is to complete the course with the fewest strokes. Each stroke is counted as one point, and the player with the lowest total score wins.
Explain and Answer:
```
**Model Output:**
```
No. The objective of golf is to complete the course with the lowest score, not the highest.
```

Now, the model provides the correct answer.

## Implementation

### **Python Example: Automated Knowledge Prompting**

Below is a Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT model to perform **Generated Knowledge Prompting**:

```python
import openai

def generate_knowledge(input_text):
    prompt = f"Input: {input_text}\nKnowledge:"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()

def answer_with_knowledge(question, knowledge):
    prompt = f"Question: {question}\nKnowledge: {knowledge}\nExplain and Answer:"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()

# Example Usage
question = "Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others. Yes or No?"
knowledge = generate_knowledge(question)
answer = answer_with_knowledge(question, knowledge)

print("Knowledge:", knowledge)
print("Answer:", answer)
```

## Applications

1. **Commonsense QA:** Improve model accuracy in answering real-world knowledge-based questions.
2. **Fact Verification:** Generate explanations before verifying claims.
3. **AI-Assisted Tutoring:** Provide detailed reasoning behind answers.
4. **Medical and Scientific Analysis:** Aid in answering complex domain-specific questions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Knowledge Selection:** Rank generated knowledge snippets for relevance.
- **Multi-Step Knowledge Generation:** Generate deeper explanations before answering.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Train models specifically for knowledge generation tasks.
