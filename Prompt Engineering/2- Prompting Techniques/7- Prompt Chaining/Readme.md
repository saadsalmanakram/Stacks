# Prompt Chaining

## Introduction

Prompt Chaining is a powerful technique in **prompt engineering** that enhances the **reliability and performance** of Large Language Models (LLMs). It works by **breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks**, ensuring a structured flow of information and improved accuracy.

Instead of overwhelming an LLM with a detailed single-prompt request, prompt chaining allows responses from earlier prompts to be **used as input for subsequent prompts**, creating a **step-by-step process** toward the final goal. This method enables better **controllability**, **debugging**, and **optimization** of LLM-powered applications.

## Benefits of Prompt Chaining

- **Improved Accuracy:** Decomposing tasks ensures better comprehension and precision.
- **Transparency & Debugging:** Each step can be inspected and improved individually.
- **Personalization:** Enhances the adaptability of LLMs for specific user needs.
- **Better Performance on Complex Tasks:** Allows LLMs to handle multi-step reasoning effectively.

## Use Cases of Prompt Chaining

### 1. Document-Based Question Answering (QA)

One of the most common use cases for **prompt chaining** is answering **questions based on a large document**. This process involves:

1. **Extracting relevant information** from the document.
2. **Generating a final answer** based on the extracted details.

#### **Example Workflow**

#### **Prompt 1: Extract Relevant Quotes**

```plaintext
You are an AI assistant. Your task is to extract relevant information from the given document based on the user's question.

Document:
####
{{document}}
####

Question: "{{question}}"

Extract only the most relevant quotes and enclose them within <quotes></quotes>.
Respond with "No relevant quotes found!" if nothing is applicable.
```

##### **Example Input:**

```plaintext
Document: "Quantum computing uses qubits, which enable superposition and entanglement. This makes quantum computers exponentially more powerful for certain tasks."

Question: "What enables quantum computing to be powerful?"
```

##### **Example Output:**

```plaintext
<quotes>
- Qubits enable superposition and entanglement.
- Quantum computers are exponentially more powerful for certain tasks.
</quotes>
```

#### **Prompt 2: Generate a Final Answer**

```plaintext
Based on the extracted quotes below, generate a concise and well-explained answer.

Extracted Quotes:
<quotes>
{{quotes}}
</quotes>

Ensure that the response is **clear, factual, and easy to understand**.
```

##### **Example Output:**

```plaintext
Quantum computing is powerful because it uses qubits, which leverage superposition and entanglement. These properties allow quantum computers to process complex calculations exponentially faster than classical computers.
```

### 2. Multi-Step Data Processing

Prompt chaining is useful when processing structured data **step-by-step** before delivering the final result.

#### **Example Workflow: Cleaning Up Text Data**

**Step 1: Identify and Extract Key Information**

```plaintext
Given the text below, extract key details and format them as structured JSON.

Text:
####
{{input_text}}
####

Return the output as:
{
  "name": "",
  "date": "",
  "topic": ""
}
```

##### **Example Input:**

```plaintext
"Dr. John Doe spoke about AI advancements on March 15, 2024. He explained how deep learning is transforming industries."
```

##### **Example Output:**

```json
{
  "name": "Dr. John Doe",
  "date": "March 15, 2024",
  "topic": "AI advancements and deep learning"
}
```

**Step 2: Generate a Summary Based on Extracted Data**

```plaintext
Based on the following structured data, generate a summary:

Data:
{
  "name": "{{name}}",
  "date": "{{date}}",
  "topic": "{{topic}}"
}

Ensure the summary is well-structured and concise.
```

##### **Example Output:**

```plaintext
On March 15, 2024, Dr. John Doe delivered a talk on AI advancements, highlighting the role of deep learning in transforming industries.
```

### 3. Conversational Agents & Chatbots

Prompt chaining improves **conversational agents** by refining interactions step by step.

#### **Example: Customer Support Bot**

**Step 1: Detect User Intent**

```plaintext
Analyze the following customer query and determine the intent category:

Query:
####
{{user_message}}
####

Possible categories: [Billing, Technical Support, General Inquiry]
Return only the category name.
```

##### **Example Input:**

```plaintext
"I need help with my last invoice; I think I was overcharged."
```

##### **Example Output:**

```plaintext
Billing
```

**Step 2: Generate a Contextual Response Based on Detected Intent**

```plaintext
Generate a customer support response based on the detected intent: "{{intent}}".
Ensure the response is helpful and professional.
```

##### **Example Output:**

```plaintext
"We understand your concern regarding the billing issue. Please provide your invoice number so we can review the charges."
```

## Best Practices for Prompt Chaining

- **Break Down the Task Logically:** Ensure each subtask is necessary and contributes to the final output.
- **Optimize Prompts for Clarity:** Use clear instructions and delimiters (e.g., ####, <quotes></quotes>).
- **Test and Iterate:** Experiment with different LLMs and prompt structures to refine results.
- **Keep Prompts Modular:** Make them reusable across different use cases for efficiency.

---

## Conclusion

Prompt Chaining is an essential technique to **improve the reasoning, accuracy, and control** of LLM-based applications. Whether for **document QA, structured data processing, or chatbot interactions**, it enables **step-by-step refinements**, ensuring **better outputs** and **higher reliability**. By implementing prompt chaining effectively, developers can unlock new possibilities in AI-driven workflows and automation.
