LLM agents are applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete complex tasks. These agents combine LLMs with important modules like planning and memory. In this setup, the LLM acts as the main controller or "brain" that manages all the operations needed to complete a task or respond to a user’s request. To make the agent effective, additional tools like planning modules, memory storage, and access to external information might be required.

Example of LLM Agent Usage
Imagine you want to know the average daily calorie intake in the U.S. for 2023. An LLM that knows the relevant information can provide the answer easily. If it doesn’t have this information, it could search databases or reports to get the answer.

Now, let’s say you ask a more complicated question: “How has the trend in daily calorie intake changed over the last 10 years in the U.S., and what impact has this had on obesity rates? Also, provide a graph showing obesity trends.”

To answer this, a basic LLM won’t be enough. Instead, you’d need an LLM agent, which could break down the task into parts, retrieve data from various sources, analyze the information, and generate a chart. The agent might need tools like a code interpreter to create the graph, and it would also need a memory module to keep track of progress.

Key Components of an LLM Agent Framework
1. User Request: The question or task the user wants to solve.
2. Agent/Brain: The LLM that coordinates all the tasks.
3. Planning: A module that helps break down the task into smaller, manageable steps.
4. Memory: A system that stores information about what the agent has done so far.

Agent Role
The LLM is like the brain of the system, activated by a prompt that defines how it should operate and what tools it can use. Sometimes, the agent is assigned a profile or persona to fit the specific role it needs to perform, such as a customer support agent or a health advisor.

Planning
The planning module helps the agent break the task into smaller steps. For example, the agent might use "Chain of Thought" to think step by step or "Tree of Thoughts" to explore multiple possible solutions. For harder tasks, the agent can use feedback from its actions to adjust the plan and improve results, using methods like ReAct and Reflexion to learn from mistakes.

Memory
The memory module stores the agent's past actions and thoughts. There are two types:
- Short-term memory: Stores recent information, like a conversation context.
- Long-term memory: Keeps information the agent might need to remember for future tasks, using external storage systems.

Tools
LLM agents use various tools to interact with external systems, like a code interpreter for generating charts or a search API to retrieve information. Some well-known frameworks for integrating tools include:
- MRKL: Combines LLMs with specialized modules.
- Toolformer: Trains LLMs to use external tools.
- HuggingGPT: Uses LLMs to connect various AI models to solve tasks.

Applications of LLM Agents
LLM agents have been successfully applied in several areas, such as:
- Chemistry (ChemCrow): Planning and executing chemical experiments.
- Mental health: Conversational agents help users cope with anxiety.
- Mathematics: Assisting researchers in solving complex problems.
- Software engineering: Automating coding, debugging, and testing (e.g., ChatDev, ToolLLM).
  
Challenges of LLM Agents
Building LLM agents comes with several challenges, such as:
- Adapting to roles: Agents need to fit specific roles, and sometimes the LLM must be fine-tuned for less common tasks.
- Long-term planning: Agents can struggle with tasks that require keeping track of a long history.
- Human alignment: Aligning the agent’s actions with human values can be difficult, especially in diverse environments.
