LLM as a Judge:

- What it is: Using large language models (LLMs) to automatically evaluate the system’s output.
- Why it matters: As LLMs improve, they are becoming better at evaluating language quality and content, making this method more popular.


LLM as an Evaluator, here’s how it works:

- System Instructions: We provide the LLM with clear guidelines (the system prompt), explaining its task—evaluating how relevant the retrieved context is to a given question-answer pair.
- Scoring Criteria: The prompt also includes a rubric or scoring system, outlining how the LLM should assign relevance scores. For example, it could assign scores from 0 to 2, where 0 indicates irrelevance, 1 means somewhat relevant, and 2 represents high relevance.
- Relevance Assessment: The LLM reviews each retrieved context and assigns a relevance score based on the provided instructions and criteria. The output might include a list of context IDs paired with their corresponding relevance ratings.

Metrics Derived from LLM Judgments:

Using the LLM’s judgments, we can generate metrics to evaluate the retriever’s effectiveness:

- Average Relevance: This metric calculates the average relevance score across all retrieved contexts. A higher score indicates that the retriever consistently identifies relevant information.
- Rank-Based Score: This metric takes into account the position of the relevant content in the retrieval list. Ideally, the most relevant pieces should appear at the top, with penalties for burying relevant content lower in the list.

Integrating LLM Evaluation into the Pipeline:
We can incorporate the LLM evaluation into our existing Weaviate pipeline:

- Define the LLM Evaluator: Create a function that sends the retrieved context, along with the question-answer pair, to the LLM, receives relevance scores, and computes metrics like average relevance and rank score.
- Integrate into the Pipeline: Add this LLM-based evaluator function as one of the evaluation metrics in the Weaviate pipeline.
- Run the Evaluation: When executing the pipeline, Weaviate will automatically leverage the LLM’s judgments to assess the retriever, generating mean relevance and rank scores alongside traditional information retrieval metrics.
