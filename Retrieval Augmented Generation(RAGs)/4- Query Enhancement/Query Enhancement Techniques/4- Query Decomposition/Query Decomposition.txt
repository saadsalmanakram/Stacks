Query Decomposition:

Breaking Down Complexity: This technique breaks down complex, multi-part queries into simpler sub-queries that the system can process more effectively.
Example: Decomposing the query "How do I log metrics?" into sub-queries about the steps involved, examples, and best practices allows the system to address all aspects of the question.
