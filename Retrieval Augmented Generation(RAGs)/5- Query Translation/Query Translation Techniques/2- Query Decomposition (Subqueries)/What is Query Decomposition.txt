This approach involves breaking a complex query into smaller sub-queries. Each sub-query focuses on a part of the problem, making it easier to handle complicated questions involving multiple ideas or steps.

Example of Query Decomposition (Subqueries)
One way to use sub-queries is through sequential retrieval:

- Identify Sub-Problems: An LLM breaks down the main query into smaller, intermediate questions that need to be answered first.
- Sequential Retrieval and Response Generation: The system retrieves answers for each sub-problem, one at a time.
- Combining Intermediate Answers: The individual answers are then combined to form a complete response to the original query.
