Cross-encoder transformers are great for improving the ranking of documents in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. They learn to score how relevant a document is to a user's query, helping to highlight the most important information and avoid losing valuable context. However, keep in mind that reranking can be computationally intensive, so it's crucial to think about how many documents you retrieve initially.

Understanding Reranking with Cross-Encoder Transformers

To tackle the issues with simple methods like cosine similarity and the "lost in the middle" problem, we can use reranking techniques. A standout method involves using a cross-encoder transformer model.

Here’s how cross-encoder transformers work for reranking:

1. Pairwise Comparison: Cross-encoder transformers are built to compare pairs of text. For reranking, we input the user’s query and each document together into the cross-encoder.

2. Training for Relevance: We train the cross-encoder to give a relevance score to each query-document pair. This training typically uses a dataset where pairs are labeled with how relevant they are.

3. Using BERT: Popular models like BERT serve as the foundation for cross-encoders since they effectively understand the context and meaning of text.

The Reranking Process

1. Initial Retrieval: Start by retrieving a set of documents using a basic method, like cosine similarity.

2. Cross-Encoder Scoring: For each document retrieved, create a pair with the user query and run this pair through the cross-encoder. The model will give a relevance score to each pair.

3. Reordering: Finally, reorder the documents based on these new relevance scores, placing the highest-scoring documents at the top.

Considering Latency

Reranking with a cross-encoder can take a lot of computational power, especially if you retrieve many documents at once. So, it’s important to consider the initial number of documents (the top-k value) you want to retrieve.

- Balancing Recall and Speed: A smaller top-k will speed up the reranking process but may miss out on retrieving some relevant documents.

- Finding the Optimal Top-k: The key is to find a good balance between getting as many relevant documents as possible (high recall) and maintaining a reasonable processing speed.
