These are safety mechanisms that restrict or guide the behavior of AI systems to ensure responsible outputs. In RAG, guardrails are used to prevent harmful, biased, or factually incorrect content from being generated. They ensure the generated responses adhere to ethical, legal, or domain-specific guidelines.

> Guardrails help prevent the system from giving responses that are:
  - Off-Topic: Unrelated to the userâ€™s question.
  - Inappropriate: Offensive, harmful, or biased.
  - Inconsistent: Contradictory or unclear.

> Techniques for Guardrails:
  - Structural Checks: Making sure answers follow a set format, like using bullet points for lists.
  - Semantic Filters: Blocking responses that use inappropriate language or concepts.
  - Safety Measures: Adding filters or classifiers to detect and stop harmful content.
