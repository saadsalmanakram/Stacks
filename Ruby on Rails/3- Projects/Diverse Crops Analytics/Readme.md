# **Diverse Crops Analytics**

## **Introduction**

The **Diverse Crops Analytics** project is designed to analyze and visualize data related to various crops, helping farmers, agronomists, and stakeholders make informed decisions. By utilizing advanced data processing and visualization techniques, this application provides insights into crop diversity, yields, and other key metrics. Developed with **Ruby on Rails** for the backend and **Next.js** for the frontend, this project integrates with **Kafka** for real-time data streaming and uses **PostgreSQL** for data storage.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The main goals of this project are to:
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze diverse crop data to derive meaningful insights and trends.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Leverage Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing.
- **User Engagement**: Provide an intuitive interface for users to visualize and interact with crop analytics.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Backend**

- **Ruby on Rails**: A web application framework for building the backend, providing RESTful APIs for data access and manipulation.

### **Frontend**

- **Next.js (React)**: A powerful framework for building server-rendered React applications, enabling dynamic routing and efficient rendering.

### **Data Streaming**

- **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform that allows for real-time data processing and integration between different components of the application.

### **Database**

- **PostgreSQL**: An advanced relational database management system used for storing crop data, user information, and analytics results.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Diverse Crops Analytics** project follows a microservices architecture where the frontend interacts with the backend APIs built on Ruby on Rails. Kafka is used to facilitate real-time data streaming between services, while PostgreSQL handles data storage.

### **System Components**

- **Ruby on Rails**: Manages backend logic, API endpoints, and data processing.
- **Next.js**: Provides the user interface and handles client-side rendering.
- **Kafka**: Enables real-time data streaming and processing for timely analytics.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores and manages crop-related data, user profiles, and analytics.
