# **Analyzing Drugs Based on Types**

## **Introduction**

The **Analyzing Drugs Based on Types** project aims to provide comprehensive insights into various drugs categorized by their types. This application utilizes advanced analytics to help healthcare professionals, researchers, and stakeholders understand drug properties, effectiveness, and other critical metrics. Built with **Ruby on Rails** for the backend and **Next.js** for the frontend, this project integrates **Kafka** for real-time data processing and uses **PostgreSQL** for robust data management.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The main objectives of this project are to:
- **Drug Analysis**: Analyze different types of drugs to derive valuable insights and comparisons.
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Use Kafka for real-time processing of drug-related data.
- **User-Friendly Visualizations**: Provide an intuitive interface for users to visualize and interact with drug analytics.

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Analyzing Drugs Based on Types** project follows a microservices architecture, where the frontend communicates with the backend APIs built using Ruby on Rails. Kafka facilitates real-time data streaming, while PostgreSQL serves as the primary data storage solution.

### **System Components**

- **Ruby on Rails**: Manages the backend processes, including data retrieval and analysis.
- **Next.js**: Provides the user interface, handling client-side interactions and rendering.
- **Kafka**: Enables real-time data streaming and processing, ensuring users have access to the latest information.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores and manages drug-related data, user information, and analytics.
