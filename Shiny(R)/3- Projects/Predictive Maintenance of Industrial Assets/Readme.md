## **Project Overview**
The **Predictive Maintenance Dashboard** is a Shiny app that:
- Visualizes sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibration) over time.
- Predicts the likelihood of asset failure using a machine learning model (Random Forest).
- Provides actionable insights to prevent unplanned downtime.

---

## **Installation**
To run this project, you need to install the following:

1. **Install R**:
   - Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. **Install RStudio**:
   - Download and install RStudio from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Open RStudio and run the following commands:
     ```R
     install.packages("shiny")       # For building the app
     install.packages("tidyverse")   # For data manipulation and visualization
     install.packages("caret")       # For predictive modeling
     install.packages("randomForest") # For machine learning
     install.packages("lubridate")   # For handling date-time data
     install.packages("plotly")      # For interactive plots
     ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Load the libraries to ensure theyâ€™re installed correctly:
     ```R
     library(shiny)
     library(tidyverse)
     library(caret)
     library(randomForest)
     library(lubridate)
     library(plotly)
     ```

## **Folder Structure**
The project is organized as follows:

```
predictive_maintenance_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.R                  # Main Shiny app file
â”œâ”€â”€ global.R               # Global variables and functions
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                  # Folder for datasets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sensor_data.csv    # Example sensor data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ maintenance_logs.csv # Maintenance logs
â”œâ”€â”€ R/                     # Folder for helper R scripts

## **How to Run the App**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive_maintenance_app.git
   ```
2. Open the `app.R` file in RStudio.
3. Click the **Run App** button in the top-right corner of the script editor.

---

## **Data Preparation**
The app uses two main datasets:
1. **Sensor Data** (`sensor_data.csv`):
   - Columns: `asset_id`, `timestamp`, `sensor_value`, `temperature`, `vibration`, etc.
   - Example:
     ```
     asset_id,timestamp,sensor_value,temperature,vibration
     1,2023-10-01 12:00:00,120,45,0.5
     1,2023-10-01 12:05:00,125,46,0.6
     ```

2. **Maintenance Logs** (`maintenance_logs.csv`):
   - Columns: `asset_id`, `maintenance_date`, `issue_description`.
   - Example:
     ```
     asset_id,maintenance_date,issue_description
     1,2023-10-05,Motor overheating
     ```

---

## **Customization**
You can customize the app by:
1. **Adding CSS**:
   - Edit the `www/style.css` file to change the app's appearance.
2. **Adding JavaScript**:
   - Edit the `www/script.js` file to add interactivity.
3. **Modularizing Code**:
   - Move data preprocessing and model training to separate scripts in the `R/` folder:
     ```R
     source("R/data_preprocessing.R")
     source("R/model_training.R")
     ```

---

## **Deployment**
You can deploy the app using:
1. **ShinyApps.io**:
   - Use the `rsconnect` package:
     ```R
     library(rsconnect)
     rsconnect::deployApp("path/to/predictive_maintenance_app")
     ```
2. **RStudio Connect** or **Shiny Server**:
   - Follow the respective documentation for deployment.

---

## **Best Practices**
1. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git to track changes:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```
2. **Testing**:
   - Use the `testthat` package to write unit tests for your app.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Keep your code well-documented and update the `README.md` file as needed.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integrate real-time data feeds from IoT sensors.
- Add advanced machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Implement email or SMS alerts for predicted failures.
- Include a dashboard for maintenance scheduling and resource allocation.
