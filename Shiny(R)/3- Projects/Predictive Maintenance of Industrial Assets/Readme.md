# **Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Assets**

## **Introduction**

The **Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Assets** project aims to implement predictive maintenance strategies for industrial equipment using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. This web application, developed with **Shiny (R)**, provides users with tools to analyze asset performance, predict potential failures, and optimize maintenance schedules. The application uses an **SQLite** database for efficient data management.

### **Purpose of This Repository**

The primary objectives of this project are to:
- **Predict Asset Failures**: Utilize statistical models to forecast potential failures of industrial assets.
- **Optimize Maintenance Schedules**: Provide actionable insights to optimize maintenance activities, reduce downtime, and save costs.
- **Enhance Data Visualization**: Offer interactive data visualizations to better understand asset performance trends and maintenance needs.

## **Features**

- **Failure Prediction**: Statistical models predict the likelihood of asset failures based on historical data.
- **Maintenance Optimization**: Offers recommendations for maintenance schedules to minimize downtime.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Users can visualize asset performance trends and maintenance history through interactive dashboards.
- **Data Storage**: Uses SQLite for efficient storage and retrieval of asset data and maintenance records.

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Shiny (R)**

- A web application framework for R that allows for building interactive web apps directly from R scripts, ideal for statistical analysis and data visualization.

### **SQLite**

- A lightweight, serverless SQL database engine used to manage and store application data efficiently.

---

## **Architecture**

### **Overview**

The **Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Assets** project follows a client-server architecture where the Shiny application serves as the front end, processing user input and displaying results, while the SQLite database handles data management in the background.

### **System Components**

- **Shiny (R)**: Manages server-side logic, user interactions, and data visualizations.
- **SQLite**: Stores historical asset data, maintenance records, and prediction results.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you will need:
- **R** and **RStudio** installed on your machine.
- The **Shiny** package and required R libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- Basic understanding of R programming and statistics.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance-industrial-assets.git
   cd predictive-maintenance-industrial-assets
   ```

2. **Install Required R Packages**:
   Open RStudio and run the following commands:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("shiny", "DBI", "RSQLite", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Create and initialize your SQLite database with the necessary tables (refer to the provided schema in the repository).

### **Running the Project**

- Open the R project in RStudio and run the following command to start the Shiny application:
  ```r
  shiny::runApp()
  ```
