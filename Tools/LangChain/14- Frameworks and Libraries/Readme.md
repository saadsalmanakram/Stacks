from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Create an OpenAI-based FAISS index
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
faiss_vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(["sample text", "another sample text"], embedding)

# Retrieve similar documents
retriever = faiss_vectorstore.as_retriever()
response = retriever.get_relevant_documents("What is LangChain?")
print(response)
```

- **Benefits**:
  - Fast and efficient search through large-scale datasets.
